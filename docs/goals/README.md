# Goals

The self-driving backlog for the autonomous iteration loop.

The loop **never stops, never asks a human for work, never
completes**. It fires every ~20 min, ships one commit, repeats
forever. The loop sets its own outward direction.

Read these every iteration, in order:

1. **[`.claude/rules/iteration-loop.md`](../../.claude/rules/iteration-loop.md)**
   — the authoritative contract (5 rules up top).
2. **[`OUTWARD-TARGETS.md`](OUTWARD-TARGETS.md)** — the loop's
   self-directed north star + target map (loop owns/evolves the
   *direction*; honesty machinery is immutable).
3. **[`CAPABILITIES.md`](CAPABILITIES.md)** — the only success
   metric (append-only; every goal adds one green automated check).
4. `MEMORY.md`.

This file is just the backlog table + ledger. The definitions,
procedure, falsification rule, regression sweep, and immutable core
live in the contract — don't restate them here.

## Backlog (append/flip-only)

Add ≤1 row, flip status of goals you touched; never reorder, never
delete an open row, never rewrite another goal's status.

| #   | Goal                                                                    | Category       | Status           |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| 373 | [Proactive multi-device routing](373-proactive-multi-device-routing.md) | epic / outward | done             |
| 374 | [`muse ask --notes-only`](374-muse-ask-notes-only.md)                   | outward        | done (pre-built) |
| 375 | [Web UI history panel](375-web-history-panel.md)                        | epic / outward | slice 2/3 done   |
| …   | *self-generated outward via discovery — never ends*                     |                |                  |

Closed infra (not loop work): 376 progress dashboard + tunnel —
human-operated; see its md.

## Rejected ledger (so fresh agents don't re-mine)

Append one line when a discovery path is evaluated and deferred:
`- <area> — iter <hash> — deferred: <reason>`

- smoke:live picker model speed — iter a147d939 — deferred: owner's
  Ollama-only picker fix confirmed working (real `/api/chat`
  round-trips, HTTP 200, ~50-60s each); it prefers the largest
  local qwen (`qwen3.6:35b-a3b`) so a full 6-endpoint run exceeds a
  5-min wrapper. Future outward (Autonomy: faster loop
  self-verification): prefer a fast small qwen (e.g. `qwen3:8b`)
  for smoke:live, or shard endpoints. Not slice-3 scope.
