# Goals

The self-driving backlog for the autonomous iteration loop.

The loop **never stops, never asks a human for work, never
completes**. It fires every ~20 min, ships one commit, repeats
forever. The loop sets its own outward direction.

Read these every iteration, in order:

1. **[`.claude/rules/iteration-loop.md`](../../.claude/rules/iteration-loop.md)**
   — the authoritative contract (5 rules up top).
2. **[`OUTWARD-TARGETS.md`](OUTWARD-TARGETS.md)** — the loop's
   self-directed north star + target map (loop owns/evolves the
   *direction*; honesty machinery is immutable).
3. **[`CAPABILITIES.md`](CAPABILITIES.md)** — the only success
   metric (append-only; every goal adds one green automated check).
4. `MEMORY.md`.

This file is just the backlog table + ledger. The definitions,
procedure, falsification rule, regression sweep, and immutable core
live in the contract — don't restate them here.

## Backlog (append/flip-only)

Add ≤1 row, flip status of goals you touched; never reorder, never
delete an open row, never rewrite another goal's status.

Closed infra (not loop work): 376 progress dashboard + tunnel —
human-operated; see its md.

## Rejected ledger (so fresh agents don't re-mine)

Append one line when a discovery path is evaluated and deferred:
`- <area> — iter <hash> — deferred: <reason>`

- smoke:live picker model speed — iter a147d939 — deferred: owner's
  Ollama-only picker fix confirmed working (real `/api/chat`
  round-trips, HTTP 200, ~50-60s each); it prefers the largest
  local qwen (`qwen3.6:35b-a3b`) so a full 6-endpoint run exceeds a
  5-min wrapper. Future outward (Autonomy: faster loop
  self-verification): prefer a fast small qwen (e.g. `qwen3:8b`)
  for smoke:live, or shard endpoints. Not slice-3 scope.
- web Playwright e2e infra — iter (375 s3) — deferred: no
  playwright.config / e2e harness exists in `apps/web` (only the
  dev-dep). Standing up config + browser install + seeded-API
  harness is its own infra task; the right-sized verified check for
  375 s3 was the `App.test.tsx` MuseConsole render assertion. A
  future outward goal can build the e2e harness if a real failure
  motivates it.
- smoke:live local-Qwen nondeterminism — iter (377 s2) — observed,
  not a regression: smoke:live ran real round-trips (owner picker
  fix works) 10 pass / 3 fail. The 3 (chat strict tool-loop didn't
  emit `time_now`; native web_search 0 citations / "no web tool";
  notes.search picked a different note) are small-local-model
  behaviour on endpoints goal-377 does NOT touch (the inbound
  daemon is off without `MUSE_INBOUND_REPLY_ENABLED`); the agent
  path P1-b2 depends on PASSED live (`/api/chat — direct answer`,
  `plan_execute (live)`). A future Autonomy goal: make these three
  CAPABILITIES checks robust to local-model variance (prompt
  hardening / model-capability gating), or tag them
  `[UNVERIFIED-LIVE]`. Not 377-scope.
- P1 audit — apps/api/test/p1-seam.test.ts — PASS: P1's four
  CAPABILITIES checks pass together AND compose end-to-end —
  `startInboundReplyTick` → `respondToInbound` →
  `createThreadedInboundRunner` → channel approval gate → real
  `TelegramProvider` HTTP, with the turn-1 user+reply carried into
  the turn-2 agent run (thread continuity through the tick path)
  and a write/execute tool blocked with an in-chat approval prompt
  POSTed to the same chat. No drift; no bullet reopened. P1
  (two-way conversation on a real channel) is genuinely delivered
  for the user, not just per-piece.
- P0-b2 production embedder wiring — iter (378 s2) — deferred: the
  embedding-recall provider + cosine + paraphrase proof shipped;
  remaining child is wiring a zero-cost local-Ollama embedder into
  `createMuseRuntimeAssembly` so production episodic recall uses
  `EmbeddingEpisodicRecallProvider`. Next 378 slice — kept separate
  from the provider so neither half is half-shipped.
  (RESOLVED 378 s3: production embedder wired, fail-open; P0-b2
  parent flipped.)
- P0-b3 production investigator wiring — iter (378 s4) — deferred:
  the investigate-and-surface mechanism (proactive loop accepts an
  injected investigator, appends the finding to the unasked notice,
  fail-open) shipped + integration-verified; remaining child is a
  real production investigator (a notes/tool lookup keyed off the
  imminent item) wired into the daemon's assembly. Next 378 slice —
  kept separate so neither half is half-shipped.
  (RESOLVED 378 s5: createNotesInvestigator over the primary notes
  provider wired into tick-daemons; P0-b3 parent flipped.)
- P0 audit — packages/agent-core/test/p0-seam.test.ts — PASS: P0's
  four CAPABILITIES checks pass together (agent-core 555 incl.
  auto-extract-tool-turn / episodic-recall-embedding /
  clarify-directive; `@muse/mcp` 375 incl. notes-investigator +
  proactive-loop) AND compose end-to-end through the real pipeline:
  a tool-turn fact stored under the run's userId (b1) is recalled
  on a LATER zero-token-overlap request via `applyUserMemory`
  wholesale injection (b2 — wording never gates it), `applyUserMemory`
  → `applyClarifyDirective` run in the live agent-runtime order so
  clarify stays silent on a well-specified request yet still steers
  an under-specified first turn to ask while the injected user
  memory remains present (b4 composes with knows-you, neither
  transform suppresses the other). b3 (proactive
  investigate-and-surface) re-run green on its own surface (the
  proactive daemon). No drift; no bullet reopened. P0 (knows-you ·
  anticipates · asks) is genuinely delivered end-to-end.
- P2 audit — apps/api/test/p2-seam.test.ts — PASS: P2's two
  CAPABILITIES checks pass together (`@muse/api`
  proactive-notice-delivery.test.ts — bare notice POST + real
  dedupe [b1]; prepped-doc POST [b2]) AND compose into one
  non-spammy real-channel flow: with a real `LocalDirNotesProvider`
  + `createNotesInvestigator` wired into `runDueProactiveNotices`
  over a real `TelegramProvider` HTTP, tick 1 POSTs the imminent
  announcement + the prepped "Related notes: …" doc (decoy
  excluded) to the real Bot API, and ticks 2 & 3 (item still
  imminent, investigate-appended body differs) produce ZERO
  re-POSTs — the real dedupe sidecar is item-derived not
  body-derived, so the composed flow honours the P2 "not noisy"
  quality bar. No drift; no bullet reopened. P2 (proactive
  delivery proven on a real channel) is genuinely delivered
  end-to-end.
- P3-b1 production wiring — iter (382) — deferred: the gated
  perception→run-context injection mechanism (`applyAmbientContext`
  + `resolveAmbientSnapshot`, fail-open, untrusted-field
  sanitised, opt-in only) shipped + unit/integration-verified in
  `@muse/agent-core`. Remaining: wire it into the live
  agent-runtime context pipeline behind an opt-in option AND a
  gated osascript-backed perception daemon, then flip P3-b1 with
  the mandated surface check (an ambient change measurably alters
  a subsequent agent answer — integration). Next 382 slice — kept
  separate so neither half is half-shipped (377 s1 / 378 s2,s4
  no-flip-mechanism precedent).
  (RESOLVED 382 s2: `applyAmbientContext` + `resolveAmbientSnapshot`
  wired into the live agent-runtime pipeline behind an opt-in
  `ambientSnapshotProvider`; ambient-context-runtime.test.ts proves
  an ambient change alters a subsequent answer; off by default.
  smoke:live ran a real Qwen round-trip = 9 pass / 4 fail, the
  pre-existing ledgered local-Qwen nondeterminism on endpoints
  this change provably does not touch — no `ambientSnapshotProvider`
  is wired in `apps/api`, so the gated-off path is byte-identical
  pre/post (apps/api 170 deterministic tests green via pnpm check);
  not a regression, not [UNVERIFIED-LIVE] (round-trip executed).
  P3-b1 flipped.)
- P3 audit — packages/agent-core/test/p3-seam.test.ts — PASS: P3's
  one CAPABILITIES check passes (`@muse/agent-core`
  ambient-context.test.ts + ambient-context-runtime.test.ts, 9/9)
  AND the target works as one end-to-end flow — the seam for a
  single-bullet target is ambient-vs-the-rest. p3-seam.test.ts
  drives the real `createAgentRuntime`: with ambient enabled
  alongside a user-memory provider, BOTH the `[Ambient Context]`
  and `[User Memory]` blocks reach the model (appendSystemSection
  merges, no clobber); a throwing ambient provider degrades the
  run (no ambient block) but never breaks it — fail-open proven
  through the real runtime, not just the unit resolver — with
  other context still intact; and with no provider there is no
  ambient block even when other context is active (privacy
  default-off survives composition). No drift; no bullet reopened.
  P3 (ambient perception loop) is genuinely delivered end-to-end.
  P0/P1/P2/P3 now all delivered + audited.
- P4 audit — packages/calendar/test/calendar-write-contract.test.ts
  + apps/cli/src/commands-listen.test.ts — PASS: P4's two
  CAPABILITIES checks re-run green together (calendar WRITE 8/8,
  voice round-trip 4/4) and each was scrutinised for "marked done
  but went sideways": P4-b1 instantiates the REAL Google / CalDAV /
  macOS providers with only the transport (fetchImpl / osascript
  spawn) faked and asserts the exact outbound request for
  create/move/cancel — not read-only, not a fake provider; P4-b2
  drives the REAL `registerListenCommand` via `parseAsync` with
  only the I/O boundaries faked and asserts every stage's data
  flowed (WAV→STT→/api/chat→TTS→played file) — full path, not a
  re-implemented pipeline. No seam test, unlike P0–P3: P4's two
  bullets are INDEPENDENT trust-closures (calendar-write trust;
  voice-round-trip trust), not a composed pipeline — a synthetic
  voice→calendar composition would need the full agent+tool+server
  stack and is an unnatural seam the bullets do not claim
  (gold-plating, which the contract bans). The faithful Step-4
  exercise for an independent-bullet target is the joint re-run +
  faithfulness scrutiny + the falsifiable-test check, all of which
  pass. No drift; no bullet reopened. P4 (close the trust-blocking
  PARTIALs) is genuinely delivered. P0/P1/P2/P3/P4 now all
  delivered + audited.
- P5 audit — packages/mcp/src/p5-seam.test.ts — PASS: P5's three
  CAPABILITIES checks re-run green together (objectives-store /
  objective-evaluation-loop / consented-action, 18/18). Unlike P4,
  P5's bullets ARE a composed delegation pipeline, so a seam test
  exercises the join end-to-end through the real on-disk stores
  with every read a fresh call (no shared in-memory = a restarted
  process / the next ~20-min tick): register a durable objective
  (b1) → restart → tick unmet → exponential backoff PERSISTED →
  restart (backoff survived) → tick met → the consented
  scoped-credential real (HTTP-faked) external action fires
  carrying the Bearer cred (b3) → restart → durably `done`; and
  the fail-closed consent gate composes with the lifecycle — no
  consent ⇒ no HTTP, the objective is NOT falsely completed and
  stays active across a restart. No drift; no bullet reopened. P5
  (durable delegated objectives / long-horizon agency) is
  genuinely delivered end-to-end. P0/P1/P2/P3/P4/P5 now all
  delivered + audited.
- P6 audit — packages/mcp/src/p6-seam.test.ts — PASS: P6's two
  CAPABILITIES checks re-run green together (action-log /
  undo-action, 9/9). Like P5, P6's bullets ARE a composed loop
  (see → undo → teach), so a seam test exercises the whole cycle
  through the real on-disk stores with every read a fresh call
  (= a restarted process): an autonomous consented action performs
  → is logged (b1) → the user reviews it → undo reverses + records
  a durable veto + logs the undo itself (b2 + b1) → "restart"
  (veto + log survive) → the same trigger recurs → the durable
  veto refuses it (no HTTP, objective not falsely completed) → the
  refusal is logged too → a final query returns the complete
  durable audit trail [refused, undo, performed] newest-first. No
  drift; no bullet reopened. P6 (accountability & correction loop)
  is genuinely delivered end-to-end. **P0–P6 now ALL delivered +
  audited** — the next iteration self-extends OUTWARD-TARGETS
  toward the north star (no human authors it).
- P7-b1 production adapter wiring — iter (390) — deferred: the
  `applyVetoAvoidance` transform is wired LIVE into the
  agent-runtime pipeline behind a duck-typed
  `VetoAvoidanceProvider` and flipped on the `createAgentRuntime`
  integration (the P3-b1 precedent). Remaining: the thin concrete
  adapter `@muse/mcp readVetoes → VetoAvoidanceProvider` wired
  into the apps/api server assembly so production runs read the
  real `~/.muse/vetoes.json`. Not required by P7-b1's stated
  integration check; a follow-up like P3-b1's real-osascript
  provider was to its flip.
  (RESOLVED 391: p7-seam.test.ts in apps/api exercises the real
  `readVetoes → VetoAvoidanceProvider` adapter through the real
  createAgentRuntime pipeline — the adapter shape is proven sound;
  only its server-assembly placement remains, a pure wiring line.)
  (FULLY RESOLVED 402: the wiring line shipped —
  `buildVetoAvoidanceProvider(env)` (autoconfigure
  context-engineering-builders, default-on, opt-out
  `MUSE_VETO_AVOIDANCE=false`, `resolveVetoesFile` →
  `~/.muse/vetoes.json`) is constructed and passed as
  `vetoAvoidanceProvider` into the production `createAgentRuntime`.
  P7's learn-from-correction was confirmed DEAD in production
  (grep: zero `vetoAvoidanceProvider` refs in apps/api +
  autoconfigure) and is now LIVE — a recorded veto surfaces
  `[Learned Avoidance]` into real `/api/chat` runs. Verified by
  veto-avoidance-provider.test.ts; no parent flip — P7-b1's bullet
  was already `[x]` on its mandated check, this discharges the
  deferred production-wiring follow-up like the P9 daemon slices.)
- P7 audit — apps/api/test/p7-seam.test.ts — PASS: P7's two
  CAPABILITIES checks re-run green together (veto-avoidance 5/5,
  personal-veto-store 5/5). Like P5/P6, P7's bullets ARE a
  composed lifecycle, but the `mcp ↛ agent-core` boundary forced
  the isolated tests apart; apps/api depends on BOTH, so the seam
  test is the one place it composes for real: the REAL `@muse/mcp`
  veto store, behind the production-shape `readVetoes →
  VetoAvoidanceProvider` adapter, driven through the REAL
  `createAgentRuntime` pipeline — no veto → recordVeto surfaces
  `[Learned Avoidance]` into a live run (b1) → queryVetoes lists
  it (b2 review) → removeVeto (b2 clear) → a subsequent live run
  no longer carries the directive (clear genuinely un-does the
  live injection, not just the proxy the boundary forced). No
  drift; no bullet reopened. P7 (learns from correction) is
  genuinely delivered end-to-end. **P0–P7 now ALL delivered +
  audited.**
- P8 audit — packages/mcp/src/p8-seam.test.ts — PASS (with a
  corrected bookkeeping drift): the audit caught that goal 392 s1
  appended P8-b1's `— 392` annotation + CAPABILITIES line + README
  "done" row but never flipped the OUTWARD-TARGETS checkbox
  (`- [ ]`, while P8-b2 was correctly `- [x]`). The capability was
  genuinely delivered — situational-briefing.test.ts re-run 5/5
  green — so this is a metric-glyph drift, exactly what the audit
  exists to catch; the checkbox was corrected `[ ]`→`[x]` (not a
  re-deliver, not a REOPEN — the check was always green). Then the
  audit proper: both P8 piece-checks re-run green together (8/8)
  and p8-seam.test.ts exercises the whole flow — the full
  situational picture (soonest-first upcoming + escalated
  "Needs you" w/ resolution + active "Still tracking", finished
  excluded) synthesised from the REAL objectives store and
  delivered intact in ONE POST over a REAL `TelegramProvider`,
  then deduped in-window by the real sidecar. No further drift; no
  bullet reopened. P8 (proactive situational briefing) is
  genuinely delivered end-to-end. **P0–P8 now ALL delivered +
  audited.**
- P9-b2 env-gated daemon-set wiring + concrete objectives
  evaluator/actuator — iter (395) — deferred: P9-b2 genuinely
  bundles (a) the situational-briefing apps/api rider, (b) both
  riders env-gated + registered in the daemon set
  (`start…DaemonIfConfigured` + ServerOptions/autoconfigure
  plumbing + server.ts), (c) a concrete production objectives
  evaluator/actuator (the LLM-ish, smoke:live-class part). Too
  coarse for one tight commit, so P9-b2 was split; child (a) —
  `startSituationalBriefingTick`, the deterministic zero-LLM
  parallel of the P9-b1 objectives rider — shipped + tested (395).
  Parent P9-b2 stays `[ ]` until (b)+(c). Honest split, the
  378-s2 / P5 precedent — no parent flip, no CAPABILITIES line
  until the parent is met end-to-end. (PROGRESS 396: child (b) done
  for the situational-briefing daemon — env-gated + registered in
  the apps/api daemon set end-to-end, ServerOptions +
  autoconfigure + server.ts + integration test. Remaining: the
  objectives daemon env-gated + a concrete agent/LLM
  condition-evaluator — the smoke:live-class (c). Parent still
  `[ ]`.) (PROGRESS 397: (c) env-gating + registration +
  `createModelObjectiveEvaluator` strict-parse + conservative
  fail-soft + `createMessagingObjectiveActuator` SHIPPED &
  deterministically verified — BUT the real-qwen3:8b dog-food
  showed the small local model does not reliably emit a parseable
  verdict, so "the evaluator decides a real objective's condition"
  is **[UNVERIFIED-LIVE]** and parent P9-b2 stays `[ ]`. The
  evaluator's safe-default means it never false-acts — it just
  defers — so shipping the wiring is safe; clearing the
  [UNVERIFIED-LIVE] (reliable small-model verdict) is the priority
  follow-up.) (RESOLVED 398: the 397 [UNVERIFIED-LIVE] was a
  dog-food request-shape bug, NOT a code gap — the script used the
  OpenAI-compat endpoint with an invalid `reasoning:false` bool
  (400) / `/no_think` (empty). Re-dog-fooded the real production
  `createModelObjectiveEvaluator` via the correct zero-think path
  (native `/api/chat` `think:false`) against the mandated local
  qwen3:8b: met-time→`{met}`, future→`{unmet}`,
  impossible→`{unmeetable,reason}` — it genuinely decides. Tag
  cleared, parent P9-b2 flipped `[x]`, CAPABILITIES line appended.
  No code change needed — the evaluator/parser were always
  correct; the prior failure was the harness.)
- P9 audit — apps/api/test/p9-seam.test.ts — PASS: P9's bullets
  ARE a composed production pipeline (env-gated daemon-set fn →
  builds concrete `createModelObjectiveEvaluator` +
  `createMessagingObjectiveActuator` → P9-b1 `startObjectivesTick`
  rider → `runDueObjectives` over the real on-disk store). All
  P9 deterministic backing checks re-run green together
  (`@muse/mcp` 17/17 evaluator+loop+store; `@muse/api` 15/15
  rider+daemon ×2). p9-seam.test.ts exercises the WHOLE chain
  composed exactly as `startObjectivesDaemonIfConfigured` wires it
  (only the model verdict — a deterministic strict-JSON stand-in;
  the live qwen3:8b decision was separately verified by goal 398's
  real round-trip — and the HTTP boundary faked): a `met` verdict
  → "✅ Objective met:" POSTed over a real `TelegramProvider` +
  the objective durably `done`; `unmet` → no POST, stays `active`
  with attempts/backoff; `unmeetable` → "⚠ Objective needs you:"
  escalation POSTed + durably `escalated`. No drift; no bullet
  reopened. P9 (the delegated-autonomy loops actually run in
  production) is genuinely delivered end-to-end. **P0–P9 now ALL
  delivered + audited.**
- P8 audit (b3/b4 re-audit) — apps/api/test/situational-briefing-daemon-imminent-seam.test.ts — PASS: the original P8 audit
  (above) predated and explicitly covered only b1/b2 (the 8/8
  piece-checks); the loop-extended b3 (400) + b4 (401) added the
  REAL task/calendar imminence grounding AFTER it. Their per-piece
  checks existed, but the actual production assembly —
  `startSituationalBriefingDaemonIfConfigured` constructing the
  `deriveBriefingImminent(tasksFile)` ⊎ `deriveCalendarBriefing
  Imminent(calendar)` union from `ServerOptions` — was unguarded:
  goal 396 tested only its env-gate/register/stop, the b3/b4 tick
  tests hand-build the union themselves. A regression dropping the
  calendar branch or mis-wiring the file would have kept every test
  green. New seam drives the real builder with a real tasksFile +
  real calendar lister and asserts the wired imminentProvider
  unions both (and is absent when neither is set). All P8 checks
  re-run green together (`@muse/mcp` 13/13 composer+loop+seam+
  derivers; `@muse/api` 11/11 tick+daemon+new-seam). No drift; no
  bullet reopened — the production code was correct, only
  unguarded; it is now guarded.
