# Loop index — all autonomous loops at a glance

> Thin aggregator (loop-creator v1.14.0+). One line per loop. Each loop updates ONLY its own row on
> commit, so this never becomes a contended append point. Detail lives in each loop's journal.
> Convention: [README](README.md).

<!-- New loops: add a row here on first registration; update your own row's last-fire/commit each fire. -->
