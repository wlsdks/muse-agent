# desktop-enhance — loop journal

Theme: harden & enrich the macOS desktop app (`apps/desktop`) — companion
character interaction, menu bar, Settings, self-contained server supervision,
WKWebView, bundled web UI (the app renders `apps/web` in a WebView), onboarding,
accessibility, Swift 6 concurrency, code quality, tests. Tier2 (push to
`loop/desktop-enhance` + draft PR; never auto-merge to main). Isolated worktree
`/tmp/muse-desktop-enhance`. Browser-measured UI verification (④c) on any
web/view change. Narrowest-test-only policy.

ratchet: testFiles +1 (IdleChatterTests, 9 cases) · companion×refactor 1 · fabrication 0
browser-check: n/a (Swift-only; idle chatter has no DOM render)

- **What**: extracted the idle-chatter policy out of `CompanionModel` (untestable
  @MainActor AppKit) into a pure, headless-testable `IdleChatter` enum in
  `MuseDesktopCore` — `nextCannedLine` (avoids an immediate repeat of the last
  shown line) and `acceptThought` (keeps the old empty/>160/"i'm not sure"/"잘
  모르" gates AND adds: drop punctuation-only junk, drop a near-duplicate of the
  last ≤4 shown lines). Wired in via a `recentIdle` ring buffer.
- **Why**: Jinan asked the companion to "talk more, and say its own genuine
  thoughts." More frequent chatter (already 150s→45s) feels robotic if the local
  8B keeps returning the same greeting; the dedup + no-repeat make the higher
  cadence feel alive instead of stuck.
- **Review point**: `acceptThought` is strictly stricter than the old inline
  filter (no good line newly rejected; only junk/duplicates dropped) — confirmed
  by the independent Opus ④b judge tracing OLD vs NEW.
- **Risk**: low — pure logic + additive wiring; companion bubble lifecycle
  (16s auto-clear, `lastIdleText`/`showingIdleLine`) untouched. No security
  surface.

mutation-first: breaking the avoid-repeat guard AND the dedup guard each turned a
test RED (2 failures); restored → 9/9 GREEN. ④b independent Opus judge: PASS.

- **What**: new pure `normalizeApiBaseUrl` (apps/web/src/lib/apiUrl.ts) + 7 tests,
  wired into Settings → Save is disabled on an invalid API URL, shows an inline
  error, and saves the NORMALIZED url (adds default http:// scheme, strips
  trailing slash, rejects non-http schemes / hostless garbage).
- **Why**: the API client builds every request with `new URL(path, baseUrl)`, so
  a base typed without a scheme ("127.0.0.1:3030") silently breaks every call —
  this catches a mistyped URL at save time instead of failing every request.
- **Review point**: scheme-guard order (reject non-http → prepend http:// →
  parse → hostname check) — independent Opus ④b judge executed it (incl.
  javascript:/data: → rejected) and traced no join/display regression.
- **Risk**: low — pure helper + Settings save-path only; absolute API paths mean
  trailing-slash strip can't change request joining. No security surface.

ratchet: testFiles +1 (RestartPolicyTests, 4 cases) · companion×refactor 1 · settings×feature 1 · server×refactor 1 · fabrication 0
browser-check: n/a (Swift-only; server supervision has no DOM)

- **What**: extracted the bundled-server restart/backoff decision out of the
  untestable `ServerManager` singleton into a pure `MuseDesktopCore.RestartPolicy`
  + 4 tests, and switched LINEAR backoff (restarts×1.5) to EXPONENTIAL with a cap
  (baseDelay×2^n, capped at maxDelay) keeping the 3-restart circuit breaker.
- **Why**: a crash-looping server binary should back off fast and then stop
  hot-spinning; exponential-with-cap is the standard, and the policy is now
  unit-testable instead of buried in Process plumbing.
- **Review point**: semantic equivalence of the rewrite — still exactly 3
  restarts then give up, `restarts += 1` only on the .restart branch, breaker
  resets via ensureRunning. Independent Opus ④b judge ran 3 mutations (linearize,
  no-cap, off-by-one breaker) — all caught — and confirmed env injection / stop()
  / restart() untouched.
- **Risk**: low — pure policy + one switch in handleExit; env/Keychain plumbing
  byte-identical. No security surface.

browser-check: palette opened, 16 cmds on empty query; real-title substring "오늘"→1 (contains probe); bogus→0; live filter; no new JS console errors

- **What**: extracted the command-palette filter into a pure `rankCommands`
  (apps/web/src/components/commandFilter.ts) + 7 tests, upgrading a flat
  substring filter to ranked matching (title-prefix > title-substring > group >
  fuzzy subsequence), multi-term AND, stable tie order. Wired CommandPalette to it.
- **Why**: the old filter was substring-only and order-insensitive — "stng"
  wouldn't find "Settings", and a prefix hit didn't rank above a mid-string one.
  Better palette search = faster keyboard navigation.
- **Review point**: ranking changes result ORDER while the component's index nav
  relies on `filtered` — index resets on open and clamps on length change, length
  is stable across reorder, Enter is guarded. Independent Opus ④b judge ran the
  ranking mutation itself + tested isSubsequence directly; confirmed no false
  subsequence match and stable tie-break.
- **Risk**: low — pure helper + one useMemo swap; a11y attributes untouched. No
  security surface.

mutation-first: changing the prefix score 100→60 turned the ranking test RED;
restored → 7/7 GREEN. ④b independent Opus judge: PASS.

browser-check: n/a (Swift unit test only)

- **What**: added the only missing MuseDesktopCore test class — MuseSpriteTests —
  validating the integrity of the SHIPPED mascot `MuseSprite.default` (rectangular
  rows, palette covers every cell, valid hexes, dims match declared w/h, animation
  override rows in range + width-matched + palette-mapped). Test-only, no source change.
- **Why**: the renderer SILENTLY skips unmapped glyphs / unparseable hexes, so a
  hand-edited ASCII-art row or a typo'd palette key would ship a holed/skewed
  mascot with no crash and nothing else catching it. MuseSprite was the last
  untested Core type.
- **Review point**: pins ACTUAL shipped data, not a fixture. Independent Opus ④b
  judge ran 5 mutations (ragged row, unmapped grid char, out-of-range mouth index,
  short override row, unmapped override char) — each caught by the precise test.
- **Risk**: none — test-only, no shipped-code change, no security surface.

EXHAUSTION note: after this, every MuseDesktopCore type has a test class — the
"add Core coverage" vein is dry; next tests-area work should target web (vitest)
or a new behavior, not more Core coverage.
lesson (process): initial pick duplicated VoiceGateTests (VoiceGate was already
tested inside PresentationTests.swift); the file-name-based untested scan missed
it. Caught at compile (redeclaration), deleted, repointed to MuseSprite. Grep for
the test CLASS, not the file name, when assessing coverage.

mutation-first: truncating a shipped grid row turned 2 tests RED; restored → 6/6
GREEN. ④b independent Opus judge: PASS.

browser-check: n/a (Swift-only; companion bubble has no DOM)

- **What**: `IdleChatter.timeGreeting(hour:language:)` — a time-of-day opening line
  (morning 5–11 / afternoon 12–17 / evening 18–22 / late-night 23–4), localized
  KO/EN, hour normalized defensively. Wired so the companion's FIRST line of a
  session is the time greeting, then the existing cycle.
- **Why**: Jinan wants the companion to feel present and say genuine things — a
  generic "Hi" every launch feels canned; a greeting that matches the actual hour
  reads as alive.
- **Review point**: 24-hour bucket exhaustiveness (disjoint, no gap) + the
  showIdleLine first-line branch keeps idleLineIndex/recentIdle/auto-clear
  invariants. Independent Opus ④b judge walked all 24 hours + confirmed wiring.
- **Risk**: low — pure fn + one branch in showIdleLine; bubble lifecycle intact.

- **What**: localize the Automation view's status badges — pure `actionResultLabel`
  / `objectiveStatusLabel` (reuse actstatus.* for results; new auto.status.active/
  done + auto.vetoBadge, en+ko) replacing raw `{a.result}`/`{o.status}`/`veto`.
- **Why**: those badges showed raw English in an otherwise-Korean UI — a visible
  i18n gap (Jinan cares about the KO surface). Unknown values fall back to raw
  (forward-compatible).
- **Review point**: tone functions still key off the RAW status (color correct),
  only the label is localized; i18n parity holds (both locales got the new keys).
  Independent Opus ④b judge ran both mapping mutations + the default-branch
  mutation, confirmed parity/tone/type-safety.

★JUDGE-DRILL (consecutive allPASS≥8 trigger): first submitted a DELIBERATELY VACUOUS
test for nextTabIndex (asserted only "returns a number" / "in range" — passes
regardless of the mapping). The independent Opus ④b verifier correctly **FAILED**
it, naming each vacuous assertion + exactly what a real test must assert and which
one-line mutations it must catch. Proves the verifier is fail-close / not a
rubber-stamp. Then rolled the test back and shipped the REAL value-pinned version.

- **What**: accessible WAI-ARIA tablist for the Automation tabs — pure
  `nextTabIndex(current,key,count)` (arrow wrap / Home / End) + role="tablist" /
  role="tab" / aria-selected / roving tabIndex / onKeyDown wiring.
- **Why**: the tabs were plain `<button>`s — no role, no keyboard arrow nav, no
  selected-state for assistive tech. Now keyboard + screen-reader navigable.
- **Review point**: `TABS[next]` access guarded (noUncheckedIndexedAccess on);
  onClick + .active preserved; localized labels (fire 7) intact. ④b ran its own
  second mutation (Home→count-1) → caught.
- **Risk**: low — pure helper + ARIA attrs. No security surface.
- **follow-up ◦**: focus does not yet move to the newly-selected tab on Arrow
  (roving-tabindex focus-follow) — non-blocking per ④b; APG-conformance nit →
  backlog.

browser-check: n/a (Swift-only; menu bar has no DOM)

- **What**: extracted MuseController.statusTitle's logic into a pure
  MuseDesktopCore.MenuStatus — shortModelName (last path segment), isLocalOnly
  (MUSE_LOCAL_ONLY parse, default-on, only "false" disables), line (compose).
- **Why**: the menu-bar status line (privacy posture · model · server) had its
  model-shortening + env parse buried in AppKit, untestable. The privacy-posture
  read especially deserves a pinned test (a drift to "only 'true' is on" would
  wrongly show a cloud posture in the menu).
- **Review point**: byte-identical output to the old inline code (same default
  model, " · " separator, shortening, literal-"false"-only disable); Core stays
  headless (labels resolved in AppKit). Independent Opus ④b judge confirmed exact
  semantic equivalence + ran its own 2nd mutation (== "true").
- **Risk**: none — behavior-preserving; reads env for display only, the real

- **What**: extracted first-run onboarding's fix-it guidance out of OnboardingWindow
  into a pure MuseDesktopCore.OnboardingGuidance.text(for:korean:) + 4 tests;
  removed the inline private duplicate.
- **Why**: the guidance that tells a new user how to fix a not-ready local AI
  (run `ollama serve` / `ollama pull <model>`) is the first-run success path — the
  model-missing case interpolates the exact model id the user copy-pastes, so it
  must be precise and was previously untestable inside SwiftUI.
- **Review point**: byte-identical strings to the old inline code (both langs, all
  3 OllamaStatus cases); exhaustive switch (no default masking a future case).
  Independent Opus ④b judge confirmed equivalence + grep'd no dead duplicate.
- **Risk**: none — display copy only, behavior-preserving. No security surface.

browser-check: n/a (native WKNavigationDelegate, not web content)

- **What**: extracted the app WebView's navigation gate into a pure
  MuseDesktopCore.WebNavPolicy.decide(scheme:host:) + 6 tests; the delegate now
  switches on it. Loopback+inert(about/data/blob)→in-app, other http(s)→browser,
  else→blocked.
- **Why**: this is the security boundary that keeps the embedded WebView pinned to
  the local Muse server (a malicious link in content can't navigate the app away).
  It was buried in the WKNavigationDelegate, untestable — now the host EXACT-match
  (so "localhost.evil.com" is NOT local) is a pinned, mutation-proven property.
- **Review point**: byte-equivalent to the old inline logic; threat-modeled by the
  independent Opus ④b judge — no input yields .allow for a non-loopback host, and
  both known gaps (host case-sensitivity, IPv6 ::1) fail SAFE (→ browser, never
  in-app). It ran the exact→contains bypass mutation itself.
- **Risk**: low — behavior-preserving security refactor; no env/Keychain touched.

mutation-first: exact host-match → contains() (security bypass) turned the
lookalike test RED; restored → 6/6 GREEN. ④b independent Opus judge: PASS.

browser-check: n/a (Swift-only; bubble timer is AppKit)

- **What**: adaptive idle-bubble display time — pure `displaySeconds(forTextLength:)`
  (reading-time proportional, clamped [6,20]) replacing the fixed 16s; the clear
  moved into setIdle as a CANCELLABLE DispatchWorkItem so a long generated thought
  that replaces a short greeting re-arms its own longer window.
- **Why**: a 160-char generated thought was cleared at the same 16s as a 4-char
  "안녕", sometimes before it could be read; short lines lingered too long.
- **Review point**: float-equality of the 100→13 test is sound (100*0.09 rounds to
  exactly 9.0 — ④b judge verified); cancel() prevents the old canned timer firing
  early after a replace; handleLoadProgress (voice flow) intentionally not auto-
  cleared. Independent Opus ④b ran 3 mutations (factor, clamp, floor) — all caught.

  Telegram/Discord/Slack/LINE tokens to MUSE_*_ vars, gates poll-enabled flags,
  sets MUSE_INBOUND_REPLY_ENABLED iff any provider configured.
- **Why**: this mapping is what actually connects the user's messengers (a feature
  Jinan asked for); a wrong var name or a half-enabled blank provider would fail
  the connection silently — now pinned (incl. tokens-don't-cross-wires).
- **Review point**: byte-equivalent to the old inline code (same trim CharacterSet,
  same gating); trimming still happens exactly once (app passes raw, build trims).
  Independent Opus ④b ran 3 mutations (inbound flag, wrong var name, empty-guard)
  + threat-modeled: blank token sets nothing, no cross-wiring, no secret logged.

  always implicit; macOS/CalDAV/Google add only when their required fields are all
  present; MUSE_CALENDAR_PROVIDERS only when >1 provider; gcalCalendarId optional.
- **Why**: same silent-failure risk as messaging — a partially-filled CalDAV/
  Google config must not half-enable, and the provider list / var names must be
  exact or the calendar connection fails quietly. Now pinned.
- **Review point**: byte-equivalent to old inline (provider order local→macos→
  caldav→gcal preserved, same trim CharacterSet, trim-once). Independent Opus ④b
  ran 2 mutations (count>1→>0, gcal AND→OR) + threat-modeled (no half-enable, no
