# desktop-enhance — loop journal

Theme: harden & enrich the macOS desktop app (`apps/desktop`) — companion
character interaction, menu bar, Settings, self-contained server supervision,
WKWebView, bundled web UI (the app renders `apps/web` in a WebView), onboarding,
accessibility, Swift 6 concurrency, code quality, tests. Tier2 (push to
`loop/desktop-enhance` + draft PR; never auto-merge to main). Isolated worktree
`/tmp/muse-desktop-enhance`. Browser-measured UI verification (④c) on any
web/view change. Narrowest-test-only policy.

ratchet: testFiles +1 (IdleChatterTests, 9 cases) · companion×refactor 1 · fabrication 0
browser-check: n/a (Swift-only; idle chatter has no DOM render)

- **What**: extracted the idle-chatter policy out of `CompanionModel` (untestable
  @MainActor AppKit) into a pure, headless-testable `IdleChatter` enum in
  `MuseDesktopCore` — `nextCannedLine` (avoids an immediate repeat of the last
  shown line) and `acceptThought` (keeps the old empty/>160/"i'm not sure"/"잘
  모르" gates AND adds: drop punctuation-only junk, drop a near-duplicate of the
  last ≤4 shown lines). Wired in via a `recentIdle` ring buffer.
- **Why**: Jinan asked the companion to "talk more, and say its own genuine
  thoughts." More frequent chatter (already 150s→45s) feels robotic if the local
  8B keeps returning the same greeting; the dedup + no-repeat make the higher
  cadence feel alive instead of stuck.
- **Review point**: `acceptThought` is strictly stricter than the old inline
  filter (no good line newly rejected; only junk/duplicates dropped) — confirmed
  by the independent Opus ④b judge tracing OLD vs NEW.
- **Risk**: low — pure logic + additive wiring; companion bubble lifecycle
  (16s auto-clear, `lastIdleText`/`showingIdleLine`) untouched. No security
  surface.

mutation-first: breaking the avoid-repeat guard AND the dedup guard each turned a
test RED (2 failures); restored → 9/9 GREEN. ④b independent Opus judge: PASS.

browser-check: Settings — invalid(ftp)→Save disabled+error; schemeless(127.0.0.1:3030)→enabled+normalized; empty→disabled; .content bounded(≤viewport) & scrolls; nav-icon 16px; no new JS console errors

- **What**: new pure `normalizeApiBaseUrl` (apps/web/src/lib/apiUrl.ts) + 7 tests,
  wired into Settings → Save is disabled on an invalid API URL, shows an inline
  error, and saves the NORMALIZED url (adds default http:// scheme, strips
  trailing slash, rejects non-http schemes / hostless garbage).
- **Why**: the API client builds every request with `new URL(path, baseUrl)`, so
  a base typed without a scheme ("127.0.0.1:3030") silently breaks every call —
  this catches a mistyped URL at save time instead of failing every request.
- **Review point**: scheme-guard order (reject non-http → prepend http:// →
  parse → hostname check) — independent Opus ④b judge executed it (incl.
  javascript:/data: → rejected) and traced no join/display regression.
- **Risk**: low — pure helper + Settings save-path only; absolute API paths mean
  trailing-slash strip can't change request joining. No security surface.

mutation-first: removing the scheme-prepend turned 1 test RED; restored → 7/7
GREEN. ④b independent Opus judge: PASS (nit: doc-comment style → fixed).

ratchet: testFiles +1 (RestartPolicyTests, 4 cases) · companion×refactor 1 · settings×feature 1 · server×refactor 1 · fabrication 0
browser-check: n/a (Swift-only; server supervision has no DOM)

- **What**: extracted the bundled-server restart/backoff decision out of the
  untestable `ServerManager` singleton into a pure `MuseDesktopCore.RestartPolicy`
  + 4 tests, and switched LINEAR backoff (restarts×1.5) to EXPONENTIAL with a cap
  (baseDelay×2^n, capped at maxDelay) keeping the 3-restart circuit breaker.
- **Why**: a crash-looping server binary should back off fast and then stop
  hot-spinning; exponential-with-cap is the standard, and the policy is now
  unit-testable instead of buried in Process plumbing.
- **Review point**: semantic equivalence of the rewrite — still exactly 3
  restarts then give up, `restarts += 1` only on the .restart branch, breaker
  resets via ensureRunning. Independent Opus ④b judge ran 3 mutations (linearize,
  no-cap, off-by-one breaker) — all caught — and confirmed env injection / stop()
  / restart() untouched.
- **Risk**: low — pure policy + one switch in handleExit; env/Keychain plumbing
  byte-identical. No security surface.

mutation-first: linearizing the exponent turned 2 tests RED; restored → 4/4
GREEN. ④b independent Opus judge: PASS.

ratchet: testFiles +1 (commandFilter.test.ts, 7 cases) · companion×refactor 1 · settings×feature 1 · server×refactor 1 · web×ux 1 · fabrication 0
browser-check: palette opened, 16 cmds on empty query; real-title substring "오늘"→1 (contains probe); bogus→0; live filter; no new JS console errors

- **What**: extracted the command-palette filter into a pure `rankCommands`
  (apps/web/src/components/commandFilter.ts) + 7 tests, upgrading a flat
  substring filter to ranked matching (title-prefix > title-substring > group >
  fuzzy subsequence), multi-term AND, stable tie order. Wired CommandPalette to it.
- **Why**: the old filter was substring-only and order-insensitive — "stng"
  wouldn't find "Settings", and a prefix hit didn't rank above a mid-string one.
  Better palette search = faster keyboard navigation.
- **Review point**: ranking changes result ORDER while the component's index nav
  relies on `filtered` — index resets on open and clamps on length change, length
  is stable across reorder, Enter is guarded. Independent Opus ④b judge ran the
  ranking mutation itself + tested isSubsequence directly; confirmed no false
  subsequence match and stable tie-break.
- **Risk**: low — pure helper + one useMemo swap; a11y attributes untouched. No
  security surface.

mutation-first: changing the prefix score 100→60 turned the ranking test RED;
restored → 7/7 GREEN. ④b independent Opus judge: PASS.
