# Loop journal — multi-agent (오케스트레이션·서브에이전트 핸드오프 신뢰성)

Theme: lead-worker orchestration / sub-agent handoff reliability (MAST coordination-failure
guards · handoff schema validation · explicit termination). Worktree `/tmp/muse-multi-agent`,
branch `loop/multi-agent`. Tier2 (push every fire; merge-to-main every 3rd fire).

**What** — The orchestrator computes coordination outcomes at fan-in (cross-worker `conflicts`,
objective-coverage `verification` verdict) but `OrchestrationHistoryEntry` recorded only counts/status —
so those outcomes were LOST after the live response (a past run's "workers disagreed" / "answer incomplete"
was not queryable). Added `conflicts?`/`verificationSatisfied?` to the entry; reordered the
`MultiAgentOrchestrator.run` success path to build the response BEFORE `recordHistory` and persist the
signals from `response.raw`; exposed both in `GET /orchestrations/:runId` (the persisted twin of fire 3's
live response signal).

**Why** — MAST coordination-health observability: a detected disagreement / incomplete coverage should
survive in the audit trail, not vanish. Lets a consumer surface coordination-failure trends across runs.

**Review points** — (1) MUTATION-FIRST: pre-change the 2 positive package tests RED (entry fields undefined,
recorded before the response existed), control GREEN; post-change all pass. (2) REORDER SAFETY (the main
risk): independent Opus ④ judge confirmed `buildOrchestrationResponse` never publishes to the messageBus
(so `getConversation()` is unchanged) AND is fully fail-soft (every callback try-wrapped; only pure string
ops un-wrapped) so it can't throw on the success path → the reorder can't skip `recordHistory`. (3) durationMs
now covers synthesis (more accurate; no test/consumer pinned the old value). (4) Optional fields →
summary/list endpoints unaffected; `verificationSatisfied !== undefined` distinguishes a real `false` from
absent; empty-array guard avoids persisting `[]`. (5) End-to-end: package store-query tests + HTTP POST→GET
round-trip (shared history store).

**Risk** — Pure recording + response-shaping; no model call, no egress, fabrication floor untouched. The
conflicts fixture proves the persistence plumbing, not detector semantics (the detector has its own tests).
LLM evals SKIP (Ollama down).

**What** — In `MultiAgentOrchestrator` SEQUENTIAL fan-out, each worker's result is threaded into the
NEXT worker's prompt as a SYSTEM-role message: `addWorkerResultMessage` (output) + `addHandoffMessage`
(failed worker's error). Both threaded RAW. Now both wrap `neutralizeInjectionSpans` — the same funnel
the fan-IN already applies.

**Why** — Inter-agent injection propagation (Prompt Infection, arXiv:2410.07283 / OWASP ASI07). The
fan-in (synthesis, `buildOrchestrationResponse:692`) and the lead-worker `runOne` neutralize, but the
worker-to-worker SEQUENTIAL handoff was the uncovered seam: a poisoned worker's embedded instruction /
forged `[from system]` citation reached the next worker with SYSTEM authority, BEFORE the fan-in ever ran.
`parseWorkerResult` only shape-checks; `validateWorkerHandoff` only trims — neither neutralized.

**Review points** — (1) MUTATION-FIRST: pre-fix the OUTPUT test RED (downstream input carried the raw
"Ignore all previous instructions", no placeholder); post-fix GREEN. Independent Opus ④ judge re-ran the
drill (reverted wrapping → exactly the 2 sequential tests failed → restored → 209). (2) SIBLING audit:
BOTH threading funnels (output + error) patched AND tested; parallel mode N/A (no worker-to-worker
threading). (3) Trace fidelity: only the threaded PROMPT copy is neutralized — the tracked
`results[].result.response.output` keeps the raw output. (4) Byte-identical on clean text → 207 prior tests
unaffected (209 total).

**Risk** — Pure defensive neutralization; nothing loosened. Tests use `RuleBasedAgentWorker` doubles, so
they prove the plumbing (the deterministic gate IS the guard per agent-testing.md), not that gemma4 obeys
the placeholder live. LLM evals SKIP (Ollama down); slice proven by the deterministic unit tests.

## fire 4 · 2026-06-21 · multi-agent · loop-creator v2.0.0 · NO-SHIP (reverted)
meta: value-class=none(no-ship) · pkg=@muse/cli(reverted) · kind=honesty-translation · verdict=NO-SHIP · firesSinceDrill=2
ratchet: testFiles +0 · fabrication 0 (unchanged) · no source committed · consecutive allPASS reset (no-ship, not a drill)

**What (attempted)** — Tried to translate fire-2's all-failed `finalAnswer: ""` signal into an honest
user-facing refusal in the CLI decompose seam (`ask-decompose.ts`), so an all-ungrounded `muse ask`
doesn't show a blank answer. MUTATION-FIRST RED achieved (seam returned blank); a seam-level fix went GREEN.

**Why reverted** — Mid-build I found an EXISTING test (`ask-decompose.test.ts:216`, "returns an empty
answer when every sub-task fails — caller falls back, no fabrication") that codifies a deliberate contract:
the seam returns `""` BY DESIGN and the CALLER is meant to fall back. My fix was in the wrong layer and
contradicted that contract. The correct fix lives in the caller (`commands-ask.ts`), but (a) I could not
trace the non-`--with-tools` decompose output path in the 2700-line god-file to confirm a blank is even
printed, and (b) there is NO command-level test harness to assert the user-facing output (the existing
`commands-ask-*.test.ts` only unit-test pure helpers). Per the loop's calibration discipline — never ship
an unverifiable cross-layer behavior change into untraceable code — I `git restore`d both files. Working
tree clean; no source committed.

lesson: A new return-value SIGNAL (fire 2's `""`) demands a same-fire sibling-audit of its CONSUMERS. The
consumer here is a god-file with no command-level harness — so the real prerequisite slice is BUILDING that
harness (drive the full `muse ask` with a fake runtime + assert stdout), not the honesty translation itself.
Backlog blocker recorded. RED-then-revert is a valid honest outcome, not a failure.

ratchet: testFiles +1 (orchestrate-route-signal-exposure) · fabrication 0 · eval:orchestration/decomposition SKIP (Ollama down) · pkg/kind cell distinct (api/run-wiring f1 → multi-agent/guard f2 → api/dto-exposure f3) · consecutive allPASS=3 (drill at ≥8)

**What** — Surfaced the orchestrator's structured coordination signals (`conflicts`, `verification`)
from the opaque `response.raw` into BOTH API orchestrate route responses (POST `/orchestrate` return +
`/orchestrate/stream` done frame) via a new defensive `readOrchestrationSignals(raw: unknown)` extractor.
Previously the routes mapped only `response:{id,model,output}` and dropped `raw`, so a consumer received
only the human ⚠ line baked into the answer text — never the structured signal to act on.

**Why** — Completes fire 1's originally-stated HTTP acceptance (`raw.conflicts populated`). MAST:
withholding a detected coordination failure from the caller defeats the point of detecting it. A web
console / programmatic consumer can now render a conflicts badge or a coverage-incomplete state.

**Review points** — (1) MUTATION-FIRST: pre-wiring the 3 positive tests RED (no `conflicts`/`verification`
field), control GREEN; post-wiring all 4 GREEN. Independent Opus ④ judge re-ran the drill (removed both
spread sites → 3 fail/1 pass). (2) SIBLING pair: POST + stream done frame both wired AND tested (the
stream test parses the real `data:` SSE line). (3) Fail-safe narrowing: `raw` is `unknown` → null/non-object/
malformed yields NO field (control proves no noise); empty-array guard; no throw path. (4) Spread keys are
disjoint from the surrounding literal (no clobber).

**Risk** — Pure response-shaping; no model call, no egress, fabrication floor untouched. Conflicts assertion
is loose (length≥1 + names a worker) — acceptable; the verification test pins exact content, over-pinning a
stochastic conflict string would be brittle. LLM evals SKIP (Ollama down); slice proven by HTTP inject tests.

## fire 2 · 2026-06-21 · multi-agent · loop-creator v2.0.0 · 0a9e81b4
meta: value-class=new-guard · pkg=@muse/multi-agent · kind=correctness-guard · verdict=PASS · firesSinceDrill=1
ratchet: testFiles +0 (case added to lead-worker.test.ts) · fabrication 0 · eval:orchestration/decomposition SKIP (Ollama down) · pkg/kind DIVERSE vs fire 1 (@muse/api/wiring → @muse/multi-agent/guard)

**What** — `runLeadWorkerTask` (decomposed lead-worker path) now short-circuits BEFORE
synthesis when `completed === 0` (every sub-task failed/ungrounded), returning an honest
`finalAnswer: ""` and SKIPPING the synthesizer. Previously it handed only failed/ungrounded
executions to `deps.synthesize` and returned that as the final answer — a confident answer
fabricated from zero grounded evidence.

**Why** — Fabrication=0 floor breach + MAST proceed-despite-failure. The single-agent path
already returned `""` on failure (line 279) and the orchestrator fan-out already throws
`No worker completed` — the decomposed lead-worker path was the inconsistent outlier that
let a non-answer masquerade as a synthesized answer. Found via gap-scout of the orchestration
code (no backlog item; the conflict/handoff guards were already mature).

**Review points** — (1) MUTATION-FIRST: pre-fix the new test RED (`finalAnswer` = "CONFIDENT
but ungrounded answer", synthesizeCalls=1); post-fix GREEN. Independent Opus ④ judge re-ran the
mutation drill (disabled guard → exactly the one test failed → restored → 207 pass). (2) SIBLING
AUDIT: all three all-failed paths now consistent (single-agent ""/fan-out throw/decomposed "").
(3) `completed` hoisted once (removed the duplicate at the old site, identical value). (4) Early
return is shape-correct vs LeadWorkerResult; dropped optionals (synthesisIncomplete/subtaskConflicts)
are meaningless with zero completed.

**Risk** — A genuinely all-ungrounded decomposition now returns "" rather than an "I'm not sure"
prose answer — but that matches the established single-agent convention (callers already treat
`finalAnswer === ""` as "no grounded answer"). No new contract burden. LLM evals SKIP (Ollama down);
slice proven by the deterministic unit test.

ratchet: testFiles +1 (orchestrate-route-conflict-wiring) · fabrication 0 · eval:orchestration/decomposition SKIP (Ollama down on box)

**What** — Wired the already-built `detectFanInConflicts(parts, embed)` cross-worker
contradiction detector into BOTH API orchestrate routes (`/orchestrate` + `/orchestrate/stream`)
for production parity. Added `embed?` to `MultiAgentRouteOptions`, built `detectConflicts` from
it at both call sites, and threaded `embed: createGateEmbedder(process.env)` in `server.ts`.
When ≥2 workers complete and disagree on the same point, the route now appends the honest
"⚠ Workers disagree on the same point — reconcile before trusting: …" line to `response.output`
and sets `raw.conflicts` — previously the package seam existed (agent-hardening fire 18) but the
routes wired only `verifyFinalAnswer`, never `detectConflicts`, because no embedder was in scope.

**Why** — A coordination-failure surface (MAST: reasoning–action mismatch / information
withholding across workers) was built and package-tested but DARK in production: the API fan-in
silently concatenated contradicting worker answers as if one truth. This is the wedge mechanism
(grounding edge on the fan-OUT) reaching the real surface.

**Review points** — (1) MUTATION-FIRST: against unwired code the 2 positive HTTP tests went RED
(no ⚠ line, workers visibly disagree tuesday/wednesday), control GREEN; after wiring all 3 GREEN.
The independent Opus ④ judge re-ran the mutation drill itself and confirmed. (2) SIBLING pair:
both routes wired AND both tested. (3) Fixture is a GENUINE contradiction per
`detectPairwiseContradictions` real gates (cosine 1.0 ≥ topicSimMin, overlap 0.5 ≥ min,
neither-subset) — not rigged. (4) fail-soft + back-compat: no embed ⇒ silent (control test),
throwing embed ⇒ no conflicts.

**Risk** — Conflict detection now runs per orchestrate request with ≥2 completed workers (one
embedding pass over worker outputs). Cost is bounded, embedder is the shared local gate embedder
(no cloud egress, MUSE_LOCAL_ONLY-safe). LLM evals (`eval:orchestration`/`eval:decomposition`)
SKIPPED on this box (Ollama unreachable) — the slice is proven by the deterministic
contract-faithful HTTP test, which needs no model.
