# Muse dev backlog — the living ledger

- ✓ IrrelAcc guard: a followup STATUS QUESTION with a resolvable word → followup.list NOT the destructive cancel (protects against over-firing now that word-ref made cancel one-shot-selectable, fires 67-70) — tool-hardening fire 71
- ⏳ FINDING (fire 71) — KO followup.cancel "그 체크인 팔로업 취소해줘" flaky 0/3 (was 3/3 fire 70): the 8B leans followup.list (the referent "그 체크인 팔로업" reads as a lookup) under concurrent-loop load; INDEPENDENT of the fire-71 slice (eval cases are zero-shot). Borderline KO-cancel selection — candidate: sharpen followup.cancel KO disambiguation, but verify it is not just machine-load (re-run when loops quiet).

- ✓ decompose @muse/cli: ollama-perf cluster (OllamaPerfEnv/ollamaPerfPostureCheck/readOllamaPerfEnv) commands-doctor -> commands-doctor-checks.ts (899->847 LOC, continues fires 25/29) — codebase-quality fire 31
- ✓ Phase 3 cont.: extracted inline memoryBlock -> buildMemoryContextBlock in @muse/recall/select.ts (+test, zero new imports) — codebase-quality fire 30
- ✓ decompose @muse/cli: moved selfLearningCheck + weaknessFuelCheck LocalCheck classifiers commands-doctor -> commands-doctor-checks.ts (939->899 LOC, continues fire 25) — codebase-quality fire 29
- ✓ followup.cancel/snooze one-shot selection 60%→100% — root cause was a bare `id` (forced a prior list); added resolveFollowupRef (word/id ref, ambiguous→candidates) + example-bearing id descriptions, so cancel/snooze act one-shot (parity with reminders) — tool-hardening fire 70 (resolves the fire-69 followup FINDING)
- ✓ Phase 3 cont.: extracted inline reminderBlock -> buildReminderContextBlock in @muse/recall (+test); formatDueLocal orphan removed from commands-ask — codebase-quality fire 28
- ✓ decompose @muse/multi-agent: worker-result cluster (parseWorkerResult/validateWorkerHandoff/createWorkerResult + types) index.ts -> worker-result.ts (825->767 LOC) — codebase-quality fire 27
- ✓ eval:tools field-targeted time-arg correctness — new argFieldMatches scorer + 5 calendar/reminder add cases now assert dueAt/startsAt carries the PHRASE (re-arms the *Iso precompute regression that whole-args argMatches couldnt catch) — tool-hardening fire 69
- ✓ Phase 3 cont.: extracted inline taskBlock -> buildTaskContextBlock in @muse/recall (+5-case test); ask god-file shrinks, presentation lives in recall — codebase-quality fire 26
- ✓ JUDGE-DRILL (3rd, verifier FAILed a gutted injection-guard JSDoc) + decompose commands-doctor env-posture trio (LocalCheck/modelEnvCheck/localOnlyCheck) -> commands-doctor-checks.ts (980->939 LOC) — codebase-quality fire 25
- ✓ mac_message_send ambiguous clarify names the candidate contacts (email parity) — the model asks "Jane Park or Jane Doe?" instead of a vague "which one?" on an irreversible send — tool-hardening fire 68

- ✓ dead-code apps/api: removed dead compatRecord fn + de-exported internal-only sanitizeConfigValue (knip-verified, barrel re-export false-positives left alone) — codebase-quality fire 24
- ✓ mac_message_send resolves a NAME → number from the contacts graph (Rule 3 parity with email; "text Jane" now completes, ambiguous/unknown fail closed, resolved-not-guessed) — tool-hardening fire 67
- ✓ Phase 3 sub-slice 3b: moved buildNoteContextBlock (<<note N>> grounding block) commands-ask -> @muse/recall/present.ts (+test moved); 3a+3b relocate the whole note-block concern out of CLI — codebase-quality fire 23
- ✓ Phase 3 sub-slice 3a: relocated escapeSystemPromptMarkers (injection defense) apps/cli -> @muse/recall (+test moved, commands-ask rewired); unblocks 3b — codebase-quality fire 22
- ✓ browser_key Enter gated — the one state-changing key (confirm/submit a focused control) now carries the SAME draft-first approval gate as browser_click/type; navigation keys (Escape/Tab/arrows) stay free, Enter fails closed with no gate (closed an ungated submit primitive bypassing outbound-safety) — tool-hardening fire 66
- ✓ isRecord dedup @muse/model + @muse/api -> @muse/shared re-export (dups 5->3) — codebase-quality fire 21
- ◦ **Phase 3 (runGroundedRecall) — DECOMPOSED (escalated after 4x defer, fire 21)**: it is genuinely multi-fire + has a hard prerequisite. Loop-sized sub-slices: (3a DONE fire 22) relocate `escapeSystemPromptMarkers` (apps/cli/prompt-escape.ts, injection-defense — SECURITY-sensitive, byte-identical move + test) to a shared home (@muse/recall or agent-core) so recall can import it; (3b DONE fire 23) moved `buildNoteContextBlock` (commands-ask.ts:210, the <<note N>> grounding prompt block) to @muse/recall now that relativizeNoteSource already lives there + 3a unblocks escape; (3c NEXT) define `GroundedRecallInput`/`ResolvedSources`/`RecallOptions`/`RecallRuntime` seam types + extract the FIRST pure pipeline stage; (3d+) thread the API ask route through the seam. Each step behavior-preserving + tested; 3a/3b touch the grounding prompt so 4b judge must confirm byte-identical prompt text (floor neutral).
- ✓ add_contact `phone` arg-grounding — a model-fabricated phone the user never stated is dropped before the contact-store write (the highest-harm contact fabrication: a wrong number reaches a stranger); grounded via the real runtime `groundToolArguments` proved in apps/cli — tool-hardening fire 65
- ✓ comment-hygiene: stripped 5 forbidden goal/task-id markers (adapter-ollama/weather-tool/loopback-calendar/history-routes/commands-pattern), WHY preserved — codebase-quality fire 20
- ✓ recent_actions `result` outcome filter (filter-BEFORE-limit so an old refusal/failure surfaces for "did you refuse anything?") + JUDGE-DRILL (inert/declaration-only/stub slice → verifier FAILed 4/4) — tool-hardening fire 64
- ✓ Decompose @muse/macos macos-tools.ts step 1: shared exec primitives (runChild/escapeAppleScript/isPermissionError/MacCommandResult) -> macos-exec.ts (1522->1464 LOC) — codebase-quality fire 19
- ◦ **Decompose macos-tools.ts (steps 2+, DECOMPOSE-ON-DEFER from fire 19)** — over macos-exec.ts base, move tool families to siblings, re-export from macos-tools: (2) outbound `mac_message_send`+`sendImessageWithApproval` cluster; (3) AppleScript app tools (shortcut_run/app_read/app_open/media_control/system_set); (4) capture/clipboard/spotlight/say. Each: move factory+its local consts, import shared base, keep re-export so callers/tests unchanged.
- ✓ Decompose commands-doctor calibration sub-command -> commands-doctor-calibration.ts (1073->955 LOC) — codebase-quality fire 18
- ✓ isRecord dedup @muse/auth + JUDGE-DRILL (verifier caught gutted fabrication-WHY) — codebase-quality fire 17

- ⚠ **differentiation loop commits raw zero-width/homoglyph bytes** → recurring @muse/shared byte-hygiene gate failures (fire 16 fixed 2: eval-policy-symmetry.mjs + differentiation.md). Their injection-test fixtures/journal should use \uNNNN escapes. Cross-loop — their process to fix.
- ✓ isRecord dedup @muse/tools (2 defs) + byte-hygiene regression fix (2 files) — codebase-quality fire 16


- ✓ Decompose commands-doctor health-check trio (messagingConfigCheck/notesIndexHealth/episodeIndexHealth) → commands-doctor-checks.ts — codebase-quality fire 15

- ◦ **Decompose commands-doctor check-cluster → sibling** — fire 14 extracted config-classifiers; the LocalCheck-returning health checks (modelEnvCheck/localOnlyCheck/ollamaPerfPostureCheck/selfLearningCheck/notesIndexHealth/episodeIndexHealth/embedModelCheck…) are a further cohesive cluster to extract (commands-doctor still ~1121 LOC).
- ✓ Decompose commands-doctor config-classifiers → commands-doctor-config.ts — codebase-quality fire 14


- ◦ **Consolidate remaining 8 isRecord dups → @muse/shared** — tools(×2)/auth/voice/model/agent-core/autoconfigure/api each hand-roll isRecord; migrate per-package (re-export the exported ones). fire 13 did @muse/shared canonical + apps/cli (3). 
- ✓ isRecord canonical → @muse/shared + apps/cli 3 dups consolidated — codebase-quality fire 13


## ◦ Open — @muse/recall extraction (codebase-quality loop)

- ✓ Relocate RecallHit into @muse/recall + move buildAskConnections — codebase-quality fire 9
- ◦ **Move `selectGraphConnections` + `NoteLinkGraph`** — needs NoteLinkGraph + resolveNoteId/noteLinkView/linkExpandRefs relocated from apps/cli/src/notes-links.ts (own multi-step). Defer until the notes-link graph types have a package home.
- ◦ **Split notes-links.ts (graph-query vs link-editing) → graph subset to @muse/recall** — notes-links.ts is pure (only dep levenshteinDistance, now @muse/shared) but TIGHTLY COUPLED: graph-query (NoteLinkGraph/noteLinkView/resolveNoteId/linkExpandRefs/linkedFromResults — what selectGraphConnections needs) shares internals (extractWikiLinks/noteLinkKey/buildNoteLinkGraph) with link-EDITING (planLinkFixes/rewriteWikiLinkReferences/auditNoteGraph, used by commands-notes). Clean split is a dedicated decompose; LOWER priority than Phase 3 (selectGraphConnections is a CLI --connect footer, not the recall pipeline). — codebase-quality fire 11 defer

- ◦ **Phase 3: `runGroundedRecall` pipeline + API route** — the contract closer (extract registerAskCommand pipeline behind a seam, wire apps/api ask route, CLI↔API parity test). Design-sensitive; small verified steps only.


> ⚠ BLOCKER (codebase-quality fire 5, 2026-06-13): `apps/cli/src/commands-daemon.test.ts` 28/71 FAILED on main (proactive: fired N/N, message length, dest dedup). PRE-EXISTING + EXTERNAL — present with my fire-5 changes stashed; my slice is comment-only in packages/*. Belongs to the concurrent **tool-hardening** loop (daemon/proactive domain, auto-pushes main). NOT fixed here (cross-loop collision risk). main has a real daemon regression to resolve.

- ⏳ **★진안/loops — repo byte-hygiene gate RED from concurrent-loop JOURNAL pollution (a MOVING target, fire 62).** Per-loop journal commits keep adding RAW U+200B zero-width bytes (ironically while documenting zero-width handling) → `/shared` repo-byte-hygiene test fails repo-wide (blocks `pnpm check` for ALL loops). Each run reports different files (differentiation.md → codebase-quality.md → …); a one-off cleanup cant keep up. ROOT FIX: the per-loop journal/write-back commit path must run the SAME byte-hygiene re-check the slice commits do (the tool-hardening loop already byte-scans its staged diff before every commit — other loops dont). Until then `pnpm check` stays red on a file no single loop owns. (fire 62 cleaned eval-policy-symmetry.mjs + differentiation.md but codebase-quality.md re-polluted.)
## TOOL theme — open (CLI-only capabilities lacking an agent tool)

- ⏳ **FINDING (fire 65) — `email`/`handle`/`birthday` are NOT cleanly groundable under the ANY-token mechanism (so add_contact grounds ONLY `phone`).** `email`/`handle` local-part (`bob@…`, `@bob`) = the contact NAME which is in the utterance → a fabricated domain false-grounds via the name token (false protection). `birthday` reformats (MM-DD) → brittle false-drop. A real fix needs per-field matching (e.g. domain-aware email grounding) in `groundToolArguments` — that lives in @muse/agent-core (concurrent agent-core-enhance loop's hot package); defer until it quiets or 진안 prioritizes. Phone is done (fire 65).


- ⏳ **VEIN THINNING (fire 61) — the cold MCP/tool surfaces are verified correct/covered; remaining candidates are description-only or need 진안.** An adversarial Opus scout swept the cold surfaces (MCP external-tool projection + ToolOutputSanitizer 50k cap/injection-defang, messaging send-gate, official-MCP preset registry, history/context/followups/reminders/notes loopback servers) — all sound. Structural tool-hardening targets (DefaultToolFilter, capToolOutput) live in @muse/agent-core (hot — concurrent loop). Remaining: (a) description-only nits (notes-multi/tasks-multi missing `domain` tag; followup snooze `id` example) — avoid-list; (b) **★진안-decision: `riskFromMcpAnnotations` (transport.ts:254) defaults an annotation-less / non-readOnly EXTERNAL MCP tool to `"read"` → it bypasses the approval gate. This is fail-OPEN vs the MCP spec ("clients MUST NOT make security decisions based solely on annotations from untrusted servers"; readOnlyHint default = false). The spec-safe fix (default un-annotated external tools to a GATED risk) is a real hardening BUT over-gates genuinely-read un-annotated tools — a security-posture tradeoff that's 진안's call, not an autonomous behavior change. Scoped to opt-in external MCP servers (allowlist); official presets re-stamp known servers. Also untested.** Next fires: pivot toward the productivity/calendar surface once those loops quiet, or 진안 decides the MCP-risk posture.

- ✓ **RESOLVED (fire 56) — Korean faithfulness 0/4 was a BATTERY bug, not a grounding regression.** `verify-faithfulness-rate.mjs` hardcoded the LEGACY embedder `nomic-embed-text` (EN-centric v1, ~50% KO hit@1) instead of the PRODUCTION default `DEFAULT_EMBED_MODEL = nomic-embed-text-v2-moe` (100% KO). So the battery measured a Korean "coverage gap" the product never ships — with v2-moe the same battery scores hangul faithfulness 4/4, false-refusal 0/12, PASS. Fixed by using DEFAULT_EMBED_MODEL. `precheck:grounding` now exits 0 → pushes unblocked. (fire-55's ca7b1863 suspect was correctly disproved.)
- ⏳ `math_eval` robustness — VERIFIED NOT A BUG (fire 52): both evaluateArithmetic copies (tools + mcp) reject malformed input by throwing→error (no crash); commas are intentionally stripped. No slice. (closes the fire-51 LANE-A candidate)
- ⏳ **PRE-EXISTING daemon test regression on `main` (cli/daemon owners — NOT differentiation)** — `apps/cli/src/commands-daemon.test.ts:119` "`--once` delivers an imminent task" fails: expected output to match `/proactive: fired 1\/1 imminent/` but got `muse daemon — provider=telegram, dest…`. Reproduces on a CLEAN `origin/main` checkout WITHOUT any local change AND after a full `pnpm build` (not stale dist) — so it landed via a merged commit (P43-5 double-booking / P37-23 email ingestion area). Flagged by differentiation fire 4 (whose own slice is isolated to @muse/autoconfigure + passes). The daemon/cli loop or 진안 should fix; `pnpm self-eval` does not catch it (it doesn't run the cli vitest suite).

- ✓ RESOLVED (fire 10 re-check): the fire-9 core-edge regression — add_contact dropping a user-stated phone, bisected to `5ec47842` — is FIXED on main (both `actuator-tools.test.ts` phone cases pass again). test-hygiene fire 9's blocker surfaced it; the owning loop repaired it.
- ◦ **`packages/tools` double-run — `helpers`(fire 11) + `time`(fire 12) DONE; `data`/`text` remain** — TWO INDEPENDENT suites per module (different it() wordings, NOT copies), both running. data/text src is the fuller side; each needs per-function EXHAUSTIVE case-merge — the lesser may hold a unique edge the fuller lacks (fire 12's `time` would have lost an Asia/Seoul non-UTC-zone case if the ④b judge hadn't caught it). `src/muse-tools-regex.test.ts` has no test/ twin (keep/migrate).

## test-hygiene theme — open (low-quality/flaky tests to fix, coverage gaps to fill)

- ◦ **FIX flaky-boundary: `@muse/messaging pending-approval-store.test.ts "caps the file to the 200 most recent entries"`** — 200 sequential `recordPendingApproval` disk appends → ~3.0s isolated but TIMES OUT at 5028ms under concurrent-loop load (intrinsically slow, like fire-2's playbook-store). De-flake by pre-seeding via one write + a single record that triggers the cap (the fire-2 pattern), same assertion. (observed test-hygiene fire 13)

- ◦ **machine-load timeouts under concurrent loops** — with ~6 loop worktrees running vitest at once, *trivial* tests (`@muse/agent-core sanitizeFollowupSummary` — a one-line `.replace`; `@muse/mcp` plan-cache `caps at MAX_PLAN_CACHE_ENTRIES`) hit the 5000ms vitest default and time out under CPU starvation, reddening full `pnpm check`. NOT a test-quality issue (functions are linear) — an environment/oversubscription artifact (plan-cache passes in 1.3s isolated). Candidate slice: raise the global vitest `testTimeout` (e.g. 5000→15000ms) in the shared vitest config so concurrent-loop load can't manufacture false failures — weigh against masking a *real* future slowdown. (observed test-hygiene fire 2)

### Full-suite AUDIT findings (4-agent review, 2026-06-13 — ranked PRUNE + ADD fuel)

**PRUNE — duplicate / double-running tests (highest value: real redundancy):**
- ◦ **`packages/a2a` double-run — partially closed (fire 4)** — deleted the 5 truly-subsumed `src/` dup tests (peer-config·receive-quarantine·signing·council-wire·handler), migrating 2 unique SECURITY cases (council-wire same-length-non-hex catch; peer-config blank-secretEnv guard) into the twins first. REMAINING: `src/agent-card.test.ts` (unique DataPart-envelope coverage) + `src/transport.test.ts` still co-run with their `test/` siblings — close structurally with a `vitest.config.ts` OR migrate agent-card/transport's unique cases into `test/` then delete. (audit a2a — partial)
- ◦ **`packages/tools` src/test twins** — `src/muse-tools-{data,helpers,text,time}.test.ts` duplicate richer `test/` counterparts (vitest.config excludes `dist/**` but not `src/**`). KEEP `src/muse-tools-regex.test.ts` (no `test/` twin — migrate, don't delete). (audit tools)
- ◦ **`packages/model` src dupes** — `src/index.test.ts` (type-only asserts, compile-time-guaranteed) + `src/provider-base.test.ts` (`isRetryableHttpStatus` re-covered by `test/is-retryable-http-status.test.ts`). MIGRATE `src/provider-wire.test.ts` to `test/` (high-value, no twin — don't delete). (audit model)
- ◦ **`packages/autoconfigure`** — `src/response-filters.test.ts` (⊂ `test/response-filters.test.ts`), `src/provider-utils.test.ts` (mostly ⊂ test/ — but verify `stringField` has a `test/` home first). (audit autoconfigure)
- ◦ **`@muse/agent-core` constant tautologies** — `followup-detector.test.ts:20`, `followup-llm-detector.test.ts:148`, `sentence-groundedness.test.ts:101` assert `CONST === <math literal>` (no behavior, no cross-module parity); behavior already pinned by sibling tests. PRUNE. (audit agent-core)
- ◦ **`@muse/agent-core` duplicate describe blocks** — `agent-runtime.test.ts` `validatePlan` (299–382) ⊂ `plan-execute-validation.test.ts`; `StepBudgetTracker` (149–195) ⊂ `step-budget.test.ts`. PRUNE the agent-runtime copies. (audit agent-core)
- ◦ **`@muse/mcp`** — `test/loopback-helpers.test.ts` ⊂ the fuller `src/loopback-helpers.test.ts` (delete the weaker `test/` one); `mcp.test.ts` has a few `toBeDefined()`-only lines redundant with the assertion right after. (audit mcp)

**ADD — genuinely uncovered high-value (security / grounding first):**
- ✗ FALSE POSITIVE (fire 6): `createCitationStreamFilter` is NOT in agent-core and is NOT untested — it lives in `apps/cli/src/citation-stream.ts` and HAS `apps/cli/src/citation-stream.test.ts`. The audit agent grepped only `packages/agent-core/test/`. (lesson: verify audit claims before trusting the package/path)
- ✓ DONE (fire 5) **`assertPublicHttpUrlSync` SSRF sync gate** — covered: file://·malformed·localhost·metadata.internal·127.0.0.1·[::1]·169.254 all blocked, public https passes; each guard clause mutation-pinned.
- ◦ **`groundToolArguments` nested-object multi-hop branch** (agent-core) — anti-fabrication gate untested on nested mixed grounded/fabricated leaves. (audit agent-core)
- ◦ **`createLlmClassificationInputGuard` provider-throws fail-close** (agent-core/guards.ts) — classifier-outage path asserts no `GUARD_ERROR`/fail-close at unit level. (audit agent-core)
- ✓ DONE (fire 8) **`createToolResultQualityAuditFilter` empty-remainder branch** — `rest.length===0` (apology IS the whole output) pinned; filter no longer turns an apology-only answer into an empty result header. Filter branch coverage complete.
- ⓘ AUDIT FALSE-POSITIVES verified (don't re-scout): `createCitationStreamFilter` (in apps/cli, already tested — fire 6); `SchedulerExecutionError` throw-conditions (scheduler dispatcher timeout/retry/clamp all covered in scheduler.test.ts — fire 8); `groundToolArguments` nested-object branch (function only handles string + string-array, no nested-object traversal exists; 20 cases already cover string/array — fire 8).
- ◦ **`formatDueLocal`/`relativeDueHint` (mcp/local-due-format.ts)** — today/tomorrow/in-N-days/NaN branches untested (drives task `dueAtLocal` shown to the model). (audit mcp)
- ◦ **`muse config show` (cli/commands-config.ts)** — user-facing read path, zero tests (only set/unset tested); `loadImageAttachment` + `muse auth rotate-jwt` command-wiring also uncovered. (audit cli)
- ◦ **`SchedulerExecutionError` (scheduler) + `withFileLock` stale-lock-steal (mcp/encrypted-file.ts) + `KyselyMcpServerStore` CRUD** — exported, no direct test (Kysely needs Testcontainers or an honest "integration-only" note). (audit mcp/scheduler)

> AUDIT VERDICT: suite is broadly HEALTHY (policy/recall/memory cleanest; security paths well-covered). Rot concentrates in (1) `src/`+`test/` double-running in a2a/tools/model, (2) a few constant tautologies + promoted-then-not-pruned duplicate blocks in agent-core. Biggest real gap: the streaming citation gate. ~15 PRUNE + ~10 ADD items → the loop now has genuine PRUNE fuel (fires 1-3 were add/fix/add because no prune candidate had been scouted yet).

## GROUNDING INTEGRITY theme — open

- ◦ untrusted-only provenance e2e firing-rate (ask AND chat) — the untrusted-only cue on both the ask (`untrustedOnlyGroundingNotice`, fire 1) and chat (`untrustedOnlyChatNotice`, fire 3) surfaces is unit-pinned, but production firing depends on the model citing tool sources as `[from <src>]`. Measure/repair the real firing rate via `eval:grounding-delta` on a `--with-tools` poisoned-source case; if firing is too low, make the cue depend on tool-only grounding directly (toolGrounded + no trusted-note coverage) rather than citation presence. (scouted grounding-integrity fire 1, broadened fire 3)
- ◦ broaden source-conflict value extraction — the `label: value` regex truncates values at comma/period (`Address: 12 Baker St, London` → only "12 Baker St"), a partial false-negative. Broaden extraction (handle comma-bearing values like addresses) without re-introducing the prose/clock-time false positives. (noted fires 7-9)

## ✓ Fixed (dedup ledger — one line each; detail in the per-loop journal)

- ✓ untrusted-only provenance marker on grounded ask answers — wired the dead `groundedOnUntrustedOnly` grounded≠true mitigation into the `muse ask` verdict path (re-export + `untrustedOnlyGroundingNotice` + verdict wiring); faithful answers resting only on untrusted MCP/web sources now surface a scrutiny cue, label stays "grounded", floor untouched — grounding-integrity fire 1
- ✓ distill-queue drain-idempotency + grounding-fence invariants pinned — the unattended distill-consumer's "dud/fail-soft event is drained not jammed, writes zero fabricated strategies" safety guarantees were untested; added 2 mutation-verified OUTCOME tests over the real file-backed stores — grounding-integrity fire 2
- ✓ untrusted-only provenance parity on the chat surface — extended fire 1's defense to `finalizeGatedChatAnswer` (every conversational surface's shared pipeline): toolEvidence now tagged `trusted:false` + `untrustedOnlyChatNotice` cue when a faithful chat answer rests only on untrusted tool sources; purely additive, fabrication floor untouched — grounding-integrity fire 3
- ✓ fail-close empty-evidence on council + reflection judge gates — verifyCouncilGrounding/verifyReflectionsGrounding called the judge with empty evidence and KEPT the claim on YES (fail-OPEN floor leak, no deterministic pre-gate); now fail-close without consulting the judge when evidence is empty (red-without-fix verified) — grounding-integrity fire 4
- ✓ learn-queue lost-update fix — markLearnEventsDone (read-modify-write) and enqueueLearnEvent (appendFile) ran without a mutex, so a correction enqueued during a drain was clobbered (silently never learned, unattended path); wrapped BOTH in the shared per-file withFileMutationQueue (red-without-fix verified; wrapping only the drain is insufficient) — grounding-integrity fire 5
- ✓ council/reflection judge k-sample self-consistency — both gated on a SINGLE judge call (flaky YES promotes a baseless synthesis/reflection), unlike recall's k-sample unanimity; added opt-in reverifySamples [1,5] mirroring recall (first-NO short-circuit + judgeConsensus), threaded from synthesize* options, floor strictly stronger (red-without-fix verified) — grounding-integrity fire 6
- ✓ deterministic source-conflict detector (evidence vs evidence) — nothing screened EVIDENCE against EVIDENCE, so two notes giving different values for the same field (old vs new wifi password) were cited as one clean receipt; added pure no-model detectSourceConflict + formatSourceConflictWarning in @muse/recall, hardened against prose-prefix/clock-time false positives (mutation-verified) — grounding-integrity fire 7
- ✓ source-conflict cue wired to the live ask path — added groundingConflictCue (@muse/recall, composes the answer's grounding) + emit in commands-ask (stderr, ungated by --connect, fires only on real conflict); the fire-7 detector now reaches the user — grounding-integrity fire 8
- ✓ source-conflict cue on the chat surface (every-surface parity) — added conflictCueFromMatches (@muse/recall) + appended to finalizeGatedChatAnswer on the user's own grounding; ask+chat now both surface contradictory sources. ALSO: JUDGE-DRILL passed (neutered detector + inert test → verifier correctly FAILed) — grounding-integrity fire 9
- ✓ reflections cap trims by recency not insertion order — the unattended dreaming store capped to 500 by insertion order while surfacing newest-first by createdAtMs, so a backfill/out-of-order write could evict a newer insight; now trims by createdAtMs (any-writer hardening, isolated-mutation verified) — grounding-integrity fire 10
- ✓ empty-evidence fail-close on the PRIMARY reverify gate — verifyGroundingWithReverify escalated to the judge with evidence="" (high-cosine empty-text match → confidence>0), and a YES upgraded a fabrication to grounded — the floor leak f4 closed for council/reflection, still open on the main recall/ask/chat gate; now fail-closes without consulting the judge (strictly tightens, isolated-removal verified) — grounding-integrity fire 11
- ✓ enricher CRAG gate fail-open fixed — the ambient "Related:" brief enricher classified confidence on `[top]` only, zeroing the runner-up and disabling the near-tie margin guard, so an ambiguous recall rode into the daily brief as confident; now classifies the full post-exclusion candidate list via pure selectEnricherLine (isolated-mutation verified) — grounding-integrity fire 12
- ✓ date-drift guard on the sync chat gate — the chat gate guarded IP/number/email/identifier but not DATES; valueNumbers drops month/day so a same-year drifted ISO date (2026-09-13 vs -14) passed; added answerAssertsUnsupportedDate (ISO-only, evidence-must-have-a-date so false-refusal≈0) before the number guard — grounding-integrity fire 13

<!-- Going-forward: `- ✓ <item title> — <slug> fire N` so the scout dedups without the verbose block. -->
- ✓ Adaptive-k score-gap recall cutoff (trim grounding-window decoys, floor-neutral; arXiv:2506.08479) — agent-core-cognition fire 1

- ✓ web Markdown link-scheme allowlist widened to `mailto:`/`tel:` (model-reply contact links now clickable; `javascript:`/`data:`/`vbscript:` still blocked, adversarial test added) — surfaces fire 1
- ✓ desktop companion stale default model: `OllamaHealth.requiredModel` qwen3:8b→gemma4:12b + `.notRunning` guidance interpolates requiredModel (was health-checking/onboarding the wrong model vs CLI's gemma4:12b default) — surfaces fire 2
- ✓ `muse find` empty-state named only tasks/reminders/contacts though it also searches calendar; extracted drift-proof `formatNoMatches` (derives from DOMAIN_LABELS) so the no-match message matches the command's real scope — surfaces fire 3
- ✓ web Tasks view rendered task dates in the runtime-default locale (lone view not threading `useI18n().locale`); extracted `formatTaskDate(iso, locale)` + wired locale so KO users see KO-formatted dates like every other view — surfaces fire 4
- ✓ desktop `MuseBridge.parseAnswer` leaked raw JSON to the bubble (and spoke it aloud) when `chat --json` returned valid JSON with an empty `response`; now returns "" on decode-success so the silent "nothing in your notes" UX fires, cleanAnswer fallback reserved for genuinely non-JSON output — surfaces fire 5
- ✓ `muse contacts birthdays --within` swallowed bad input (`abc`→silent default 30, `-5`→"next -5 days") unlike its MCP tool twin (1..365 clamp) and sibling CLI flags; now rejects non-finite/<1 with exit 1 + clamps to 1..365 — surfaces fire 6
- ✓ web Memory subtitle dangled a bare "Updated"/"업데이트" label (baked into `memory.subtitle`) when the memory had no `updatedAt`, in both locales; split the label into a `memory.updated {when}` key + `memorySubtitle` helper so the subtitle is a clean sentence when absent — surfaces fire 7
- ✓ desktop `stripCitationsForSpeech` spoke leaked source file paths aloud — the receipt-strip regex `\s*📎[^\n]*` only removed the multi-line receipt's HEADER line; widened to `\s*📎[\s\S]*` (trailing receipts) so the whole block is dropped from speech (+JUDGE-DRILL: verifier proved it FAILs an inert test, PASSes the real RED→GREEN one) — surfaces fire 8
- ✓ `muse remind list --search <text>` free-text filter (sibling parity with `tasks list`; reminders-list had only --status/--local/--json despite reminders carrying a searchable `text`); pure `filterRemindersBySearch` + total recompute across local/API/fallback paths — surfaces fire 9
- ✓ web Today `timeUntil` showed "in 0m"/"0분 후" for events 0–29s away (`Math.round` to 0 minutes); now-guard widened to `ms<0 || min===0` so the rounds-to-zero window reads "now"/"지금" — surfaces fire 10
- ✓ desktop `MusePresenter.present` returned `speechText: ""` (not nil) for a receipt/citation-only answer that strips to empty — the consumer's `if let speech` then animated the orb "speaking" + spoke an empty utterance; collapse empty stripped speech to nil (honors the documented nil⇒silent contract) — surfaces fire 11
- ✓ `muse checkins list --status` swallowed typos (`fierd`→"No fierd check-ins.", exit 0, indistinguishable from a real empty result) unlike the strict `tasks list --status`; added enum {scheduled,fired,all} validation → stderr error + exit 1 + did-you-mean — surfaces fire 12
- ✓ web decorative `Icon` SVGs (shared `base` factory in ui.tsx) lacked `aria-hidden`/`focusable`, so screen readers announced stray/doubled graphics on title-named icon buttons; added `aria-hidden="true" focusable={false}` → every Icon inherits it (a11y) — surfaces fire 13
- ✓ `muse followup list --status` swallowed typos via lenient readFollowupStatusFilter (any unknown → silent "scheduled", wrong set shown) — the last unhardened --status sibling; added enum {scheduled,fired,cancelled,all} validation → stderr error + exit 1 + did-you-mean — surfaces fire 14
- ✓ `upcoming_birthdays` agent tool — conversational "whose birthday is coming up?" (resolveUpcomingBirthdays was CLI/brief-only, no agent tool) — tool-hardening fire 47
- ✓ `on_this_day_notes` agent tool — conversational date-cued note recall (muse on-this-day was CLI-only; pure recall logic moved to @muse/mcp, CLI re-exports) — tool-hardening fire 48
- ✓ `feeds_search` agent tool — conversational watched-feed archive search (CLI-only + only knowledge_search covered it, off by default → default-posture gap) — tool-hardening fire 49
- ✓ `find_contact` hardening — surfaces `about`/`connections` (recall material the handler dropped, e.g. "allergic to nuts") so "what do I know about Bob?" answers from the tool; reverse-lookup by phone/email/@handle locked + advertised — tool-hardening fire 50
- ✓ `muse.tasks.list` tag filter — "show my tasks tagged work" (list filtered only by status/dueWithinDays; tags first-class but unfilterable) — tool-hardening fire 51
- ✓ `overdue_contacts` agent tool — "who haven't I talked to in a while?" relationship-decay nudge (overdueContacts was CLI-only; tool placed in @muse/autoconfigure to avoid a new dep edge, interactionsFromEvents moved there, CLI re-exports) — tool-hardening fire 52
- ✓ ADD coverage: `interactionsFromEvents` invalid-`startsAt` drop branch (`Number.isFinite(event.ms)`) — was uncovered by both autoconfigure + CLI tests; mutation-proven (RED on filter removal) — test-hygiene fire 1
- ✓ FIX flaky timeout: `@muse/mcp playbook-store "weighted eviction"` was intrinsically ~5.1s (121 sequential recordPlaybookStrategy disk writes) → rewrote setup to 1 writePlaybook pre-seed + 1 record overflow (285ms), same assertions, mutation-proven (FIFO mutant → RED) — test-hygiene fire 2
- ✓ ADD coverage: `formatCoarseAge` ≥2-year branch (`.toFixed(0)` whole years) in @muse/recall — only the <2y 1-decimal path was tested; mutation-proven (toFixed(1) mutant → '2.2y'≠'2y' RED) — test-hygiene fire 3
- ✓ PRUNE a2a double-run: deleted 5 subsumed `src/*.test.ts` (peer-config·receive-quarantine·signing·council-wire·handler), migrated 2 unique security cases to the `test/` twins; testFiles 924→919; mutation-proven, 3 judge rounds (2 caught real loss) — test-hygiene fire 4
- ✓ ADD SSRF coverage: `assertPublicHttpUrlSync` sync gate (mcp/web-url-guard.ts) had zero direct tests — 5 cases (protocol/blocked-host/private-addr/ok), each guard clause mutation-pinned — test-hygiene fire 5
- ✓ ADD `createToolResultQualityAuditFilter` gating: direct unit test pins the verified-source + tool-ran gates (an honest apology survives when no source backs a rewrite); each clause isolated + mutation-pinned — test-hygiene fire 6
- ✓ PRUNE `model/src/index.test.ts` (3 type-conformance tautologies — assert what was just written; tsc + test/model.test.ts + provider-wire cover the real shape/behavior) — test-hygiene fire 7
- ✓ FIX byte-hygiene baseline regression (raw U+200B in `scripts/eval-policy-symmetry.mjs:36` + `docs/goals/loops/differentiation.md:262`, both differentiation-loop files) → `\u200b` escape, value-preserving; unblocked repo-wide `pnpm check` — test-hygiene fire 7
- ✓ ADD `createToolResultQualityAuditFilter` empty-remainder (`rest.length===0`) branch — apology-only answer preserved, not mangled into an empty result header; mutation-pinned; + self-fixed raw U+200B pasted into the fire-7 journal/backlog while documenting the fire-7 byte fix — test-hygiene fire 8
- ✓ JUDGE-DRILL (fire 9): injected an inert `typeof===string` test → ④b judge correctly returned FAIL (mutation-immune) → rolled back; proves the judge isn't rubber-stamping. + ADD `formatDueLocal` tomorrow/in-N-days branch-precise coverage (was only loose-OR-matched); redundant unparseable case removed per judge — test-hygiene fire 9
- ✓ PRUNE model double-run: `isRetryableHttpStatus` tested by both `src/provider-base.test.ts` (8 cases, fuller) + `test/is-retryable-http-status.test.ts` (4); migrated test/'s unique `499→false` lower-boundary into src/ then deleted test/; mutation-pinned (≥500→≥499 reds 499); testFiles 943→942 — test-hygiene fire 10
- ✓ PRUNE tools double-run (`muse-tools-helpers` pair): `src/`(11 cases) is a strict behavioral superset of `test/`(7) for the arg-parser helpers; deleted the lesser `test/muse-tools-helpers.test.ts`; readOptionalDate 3-state mutation-pinned (both invalid sub-branches); testFiles 944→943 — test-hygiene fire 11
- ✓ PRUNE tools double-run (`muse-tools-time` pair): kept the fuller `test/`(18→19), deleted `src/muse-tools-time.test.ts`(13); migrated 2 src-unique cases first (uppercase weekday + Asia/Seoul non-UTC zone — the latter caught by ④b judge's 1st FAIL), both mutation-pinned; testFiles 945→944 — test-hygiene fire 12
- ✓ PRUNE tools double-run (`muse-tools-text` pair): kept the fuller `src/`(18→20, has the 3 caps), deleted `test/muse-tools-text.test.ts`(14); migrated 2 test-unique cases first (ZWJ-family grapheme + MarkdownTable column-union/empty-fill — the latter caught by ④b judge's 1st FAIL), both mutation-pinned; testFiles 946→945 — test-hygiene fire 13
- ✓ `muse.tasks.search` matches tags — a task tagged "work" (word not in title/notes) is now found by searching "work" (completes the fire-51 tag story: list FILTERS by tag, search now FINDS by tag) + JUDGE-DRILL (verifier caught a deliberately-inert version) — tool-hardening fire 53
- ✓ `week_agenda` agent tool — "what's my week look like?" ONE merged view of events+tasks+birthdays by day (muse week was CLI-only; groupWeekAgenda moved to @muse/autoconfigure, CLI re-exports) — tool-hardening fire 54
- ✓ `recent_actions` agent tool — "what have you done for me?" lists Muse's autonomous action log (performed/refused/failed, what+why+when) most-recent-first; was CLI-only (muse actions); internal userId/id/prevHash not leaked — tool-hardening fire 63
- ✓ `muse.calendar.list` query filter — "find my meeting with Bob this week" was inexpressible (list had only from/to/provider, no text filter; reminders.list already has search); added optional `query` over title/location/notes — tool-hardening fire 62
- ✓ `home_action` blast-radius guard — an entity-less service call (e.g. `light.turn_off` with no entity) is HA's "apply to EVERY device in the domain" path (whole-house off / every-lock unlock); now fail-closed unless entity or a data target (entity_id/area_id/device_id/target) resolves a scope — tool-hardening fire 60
- ✓ `list_objectives` agent tool — "what objectives are you tracking for me?" lists Muse's live standing objectives (active/escalated); were CLI/passive-only, no agent tool — tool-hardening fire 59
- ✓ `web_action` method validation — a model-emitted GET (read verb) for a book/post intent silently reported performed:true (false success); a garbage verb hit fetch opaquely. Now an allow-set {POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE} shared by schema enum + handler, fail-closed before approval/HTTP — tool-hardening fire 58
- ✓ `web_action` SSRF-after-redirect closed — the state-changing web actuator followed a 3xx (body included on 307/308) to a private/loopback host the URL guard never vetted; now `redirect:"manual"` + fail-closed on 3xx (the read path already re-checked; the write path didn't) — tool-hardening fire 55
- ✓ `muse.tasks.list` tag filter — "show my tasks tagged work" was inexpressible (list filtered only by status/dueWithinDays, search ignores tags) though tags are first-class + CLI `--tag` exists; added optional `tag` (case-insensitive exact, both branches) — tool-hardening fire 51
- ✓ `egressGuards` self-eval ratchet — local-by-construction moat (cloud egress refused in code) promoted to a deterministic scoreboard regression gate, mirroring the grounding ratchet (a structural edge hermes/openclaw can't copy) — differentiation fire 1
- ✓ `egressGuards` ratchet widened to the voice egress guard — mic audio's cloud STT/TTS path now ratcheted too (drop the MUSE_LOCAL_ONLY voice cloud-key-ignore → self-eval exits 1); value 5→6 — differentiation fire 2
- ✓ `eval:memory-poisoning` adversarial proof battery — proves Muse drops a model-asserted/poisoned claim at WRITE time (`dropModelAssertedValues`) that rivals' frequency-promotion (OpenClaw dreaming minRecallCount 3) would promote; deterministic, no Ollama — differentiation fire 3
- ✓ embedder local-only egress gap CLOSED — `createOllamaEmbedder` followed `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` with no local-only check (chat router only gates it for providerId ollama; daemon bypassed the router), so a remote `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` egressed the user's raw note/memory/episode text under MUSE_LOCAL_ONLY; added construction-time fail-close + 6 behavioural tests + folded the throw into the egressGuards ratchet (6→7) — differentiation fire 4
- ✓ browser act-path ambiguous-target fail-close — element matcher silently clicked/typed the FIRST of several tied "best" matches (two "Delete" buttons → guessed); now `matchElementResult` → `ambiguous` refuses `browser_click`/`browser_type` BEFORE snapshot-mutation/approval-gate, returns candidates + ordinal hint (closes an outbound-safety fail-open hole) — tool-mcp-browser fire 1
- ✓ official-public-MCP preset registry (axis B) — `packages/mcp/src/official-mcp-presets.ts`: curated `createGitHubMcpServer` (`https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/`) + `createNotionMcpServer` (`https://mcp.notion.com/mcp`) streamable factories, each carrying an official anyone-may-connect provenance URL + a FAIL-CLOSE `toolRisk` classifier (read tools listed, every write/unknown → `write`) + `withOfficialMcpRisk` projection (domain `external`); wired through the existing `allowedServerNames` allowlist; contract-faithful transport-fake test proves allowlisted connects/read-surfaces & non-allowlisted refuses & write stays gated — tool-mcp-browser fire 2
- ✓ external-MCP presets wired LIVE (axis B, opt-in, write-gated) — per-server env toggles (`MUSE_GITHUB_MCP_ENABLED`/`MUSE_NOTION_MCP_ENABLED`, derived `MUSE_<NAME>_MCP_ENABLED`) register the dormant preset into `assembleMcpStack` + strict allowlist ONLY when set (default OFF), and `withOfficialMcpRisk(withChromeDevToolsRisk(toMuseTools()))` in the live projection re-stamps write/unknown external tools to `write` so they hit `toolApprovalGate` (the toggle alone would be fail-OPEN — shipped coupled). No secret, autoConnect false; 10 behavioural cases (off⇒absent, on⇒read usable, on⇒write gated). Mirrors the chrome-devtools precedent exactly — tool-mcp-browser fire 3
- ✓ browser_type fail-close on non-typeable target (axis C) — a `type` intent whose only match was a button/link silently matched it, drafted "type X into <button>", the user CONFIRMED, then `controller.type`/`locator.fill` threw on the button (misleading outbound-safety draft + wasted confirm + no retarget signal); matcher now returns `notypeable` and `browser_type` refuses with the page`s real text fields BEFORE the approval gate. Distinct from fire-1 ambiguous-tie (this is wrong-KIND-of-target); click/hover unchanged. 72 browser tests, eval:browser-agent 1/1 LIVE — tool-mcp-browser fire 4
- ✓ external-MCP write draft-first e2e PROOF (axis B, outbound-safety capstone) — new battery drives the REAL McpManager register/connect/toMuseTools + withOfficialMcpRisk + AgentRuntime toolApprovalGate (transport-only `callTool` spy, NOT a fake registry) proving GitHub `create_issue` (risk write) is gated and deny/timeout-undeliverable/absent-consent ⇒ ZERO transport write calls, confirmed ⇒ exactly one, read (`get_me`) ungated. Non-vacuous: allow-through/skip-restamp mutation (test-side AND prod-side) makes the deny cases RED. 6 cases — tool-mcp-browser fire 5
- ✓ browser link destinations surfaced to the model (axis C, read-side capability) — link elements carried no URL (snapshot read href only for dedup then discarded it), so the model could click a link but never report WHERE it goes without navigating ("what`s the link to their pricing page?" was inexpressible); now `SnapshotElement.url` carries each anchor`s resolved ABSOLUTE href into the browser_read/browser_open element JSON (emitted only when present, buttons/fields unchanged) + browser_read description advertises link-destination answers. No new tool (augments read path, keeps the 9-tool set). 75 browser tests, smoke #19 LIVE (absolute+relative-resolves+non-link-none), eval:browser-agent 1/1, eval:tools 97% no mis-selection — tool-mcp-browser fire 6
- ✓ external-MCP preset credential resolution (axis B) — enabled GitHub/Notion presets now resolve the user`s token from `GITHUB_MCP_TOKEN`/`NOTION_MCP_TOKEN` env or `~/.muse/mcp-credentials.json` (existing readCredentialsSync env-wins-then-file secure seam, same as model/messaging keys) and inject `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; absent credential ⇒ preset NOT enabled & NOT allowlisted (fail-closed, no blank-auth half-connection); secret never in any serialized/loggable safe-config (leak test catches token AND "Bearer"). 21 cases (13 resolver + 8 behavioral) — tool-mcp-browser fire 7
- ✓ browser navigation-status fidelity for open/back (axis C) — page.goto/goBack resolve (don't throw) on HTTP 4xx/5xx, so a 404/500 error page was returned to the model AS IF the requested content (silent grounding hole); now PageSnapshot.httpStatus is captured from the goto/goBack HTTPResponse (consume-once in snapshot() AFTER the settle-retry loop) and browser_open/browser_back emit {httpStatus, statusError} only when >=400 (200/absent silent). Honest redo of rolled-back fire 8 — open/back ONLY, NO click claim/fake test. 84 tests + LIVE smoke #20 (real headless Chrome vs localhost 404/200) — tool-mcp-browser fire 9
- ✓ muse doctor reports external-MCP preset posture (axis B) — `muse doctor --local` now shows, per official-public preset (GitHub/Notion), enabled (env toggle) + credentialPresent (BOOLEAN, never the token) + allowed (allowlist) + official provenanceUrl, so a privacy-first user audits which external servers the agent is eligible to reach and why. Pure describeOfficialMcpPosture(env) in autoconfigure + cli doctor wiring; leak-guard test RED-able (token 0 occurrences, live-verified). Completes the external-MCP trust/observability story — tool-mcp-browser fire 10
- ✓ browser prompt-dialog response fidelity (axis C) — a native JS prompt() was auto-accepted with a bare dialog.accept() = EMPTY string, discarding the page's own defaultValue (prompt("Enter coupon","SAVE10") sent blank, breaking an approved action with no signal); now prompt dialogs accept with the dialog's OWN defaultValue (never invented text) and surface the submitted text as PageSnapshot.dialog.response. alert/confirm/beforeunload unchanged. RED-able vs REAL headless Chrome (live smoke 10b: revert→blank RED, fix→SAVE10). 85 tests — tool-mcp-browser fire 11
- ✓ external-MCP registry EXPANSION: Linear (axis B, 3rd official-public preset) — added Linear's official hosted remote MCP (https://mcp.linear.app/mcp, provenance linear.app/docs/mcp, OAuth2.1 + Authorization: Bearer personal API key, anyone-may-connect — judge-verified vs Linear's own docs) reusing the full machinery: registry factory + fail-close linearMcpToolRisk (23 documented read tools→read, all create/update/unknown→write) + auto-derived MUSE_LINEAR_MCP_ENABLED toggle + LINEAR_MCP_TOKEN credential + doctor posture. Hardened the credential resolver: presetEnvTokenKey() now auto-derives <NAME>_MCP_TOKEN GATED on Object.hasOwn(OFFICIAL_MCP_PRESETS,name) (arbitrary name never reads an ambient env token — env-exfil surface closed). No secret shipped — tool-mcp-browser fire 12
- ✓ browser CDP protocolTimeout bounded (axis C, reliability) — puppeteer's default protocolTimeout (180s) was left unset and the snapshot-capture page.evaluate calls (innerText/element-walk) had NO higher-level timeout, so a stuck CDP roundtrip hung the agent ~3min with no recovery (a prod agent can't be SIGKILLed); now connect() threads protocolTimeout = max(requested, timeoutMs+15s) (default 30s, ~6x under 180s) — ALWAYS above the per-op timeout so a legit slow nav/click/fill is never killed first. RED-able vs REAL headless Chrome (smoke #21: a HANG_HTML innerText forever-getter; reverted→pending 45s+, fixed→fast-fail ~19.5s). 89 tests — tool-mcp-browser fire 13
- ✓ external-MCP registry EXPANSION: Sentry (axis B, 4th official-public preset) — added Sentry's official hosted remote MCP (https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp, provenance getsentry/sentry-mcp, anyone-may-connect via the vendor OAuth flow — judge-verified) reusing the full machinery (registry + fail-close sentryMcpToolRisk [27 read tools→read, all create/update/add/unknown→write] + auto-derived MUSE_SENTRY_MCP_ENABLED + SENTRY_MCP_TOKEN + doctor posture). Error/monitoring = a 4th distinct dev category (after code/docs/issues). AUTH NUANCE (honest): Sentry's endpoint is OAuth-primary; direct Bearer-token is upstream-tracked not-yet-shipped (getsentry/sentry-mcp#833) — Muse's Bearer seam is forward-compatible, and absent/rejected credential fail-closes (no blank-auth half-connection), documented in the preset. No secret shipped — tool-mcp-browser fire 14
- ✓ `muse doctor` surfaces embedder OLLAMA_BASE_URL locality — `evaluateLocalOnlyPosture` now flags status `fail` when local-only is on but OLLAMA_BASE_URL is off-box (a localhost lmstudio chat + remote embedder no longer reports a false "🔒 ok"); same base resolution as the fire-4 runtime guard so doctor and runtime never diverge — differentiation fire 5
- ✓ shared `resolveEmbedderBase()` helper — fire-4 runtime guard + fire-5 doctor posture now resolve the embedder base through ONE `@muse/autoconfigure` helper, so doctor↔runtime parity is structural (can't drift) not two hand-kept literals; behaviour-preserving (532/532) + 4 helper unit cases — differentiation fire 7
- ✓ receipt verifies the quote against the file ON DISK (L4 shows-its-work) — `formatSourceReceipts` (@muse/recall) gained a disk-content map; a snippet edited/deleted after indexing is now hidden with a reason instead of quoted (fake-citation defense rivals can't pay for); proven by `eval:receipt-drift` (real temp files), backward-compat (recall 88/88) — differentiation fire 8

- ✓ JUDGE-DRILL (verifier proven) + truncated-snippet disk-verify coverage — planted an inert test, the independent Opus judge correctly FAILED it (mutation-proven), then landed a real discriminating test locking down fire-8's `…`-truncation disk-verify path (mutation: break `snippetOnDisk` → real test fails) — differentiation fire 9
- ✓ L4 LIVE — `muse ask` disk-verifies cited snippets — `buildDiskContents` (@muse/recall) reads each cited note's current content (ad-hoc skipped) and `commands-ask.ts` feeds it to the receipt, so a drifted/deleted note's snippet is now hidden from the user ("changed since" / "no longer on disk") instead of quoted as a fake citation; recall 95/95, grounding engine untouched — differentiation fire 10
- ✓ L5 action-log tamper-evidence proof battery — `eval:action-log-tamper` proves every autonomous action (performed+refused) is sealed in a genesis-anchored SHA-256 chain: edit/deletion/reorder caught at a precise index, refused actions chained, undo extends (never breaks) the chain — an integrity guarantee rivals' snapshot-rollback (hermes) / un-undoable promoted memory (openclaw #62184) lack; imports @muse/mcp read-only, deterministic, no Ollama — differentiation fire 11
- ✓ L6 deterministic-safety-as-code proof battery — `eval:policy-symmetry` proves @muse/policy guards are model-independent + language-symmetric: injection caught identically in EN/KO/CN, zero-width/homoglyph/HTML-entity obfuscation normalized then caught, PII masked non-destructively (vs hermes #5322 which writes *** into source files), benign prose not over-blocked; imports @muse/policy read-only, deterministic, no Ollama — differentiation fire 12
- ✓ differentiation proofs mechanically defended — `differentiationBatteries` ratchet in `pnpm self-eval` counts the 4 proof batteries (L2/L4/L5/L6 marker), so deleting one fails the build; `pnpm eval:differentiation` bundles all 4 into one command — the edge evidence can't silently rot (egressGuards/groundedSurfaces pattern) — differentiation fire 13
- ✓ L7 outbound fail-close proof battery — `eval:consent-fail-close` proves `performConsentedAction` (@muse/mcp) fail-closes every outbound vector (no-consent/scope-mismatch/host-mismatch/veto/timeout → ZERO external effect, fetch never called) while only a recorded scoped consent sends the credential; contract-faithful HTTP fake, deterministic; auto-folded into differentiationBatteries (4→5) — differentiation fire 14
- ✓ L7 widening: recipient resolved, never guessed (outbound-safety rule 3) — `eval:recipient-resolution` proves `resolveContact` (@muse/mcp) returns `ambiguous` with all candidates on multiple matches (never best-guesses one), `unknown` on no-match/empty/relationship-word, and resolves a unique match by name/email/handle — so "message Alex" with two Alexes clarifies instead of auto-sending to the wrong one; deterministic, ratchet 5→6 — differentiation fire 15

## ◦ Open — differentiation (vs hermes/openclaw — `differentiation` loop)

- ⏳ **fresh non-contended axis VEIN EXHAUSTED (fire 16)** — after 7 levers (L1–L7) + 6 CI-defended batteries, a research pass found no genuinely new non-contended axis; the one fresh competitor weakness (self-authored-skill admission, hermes #25833 / openclaw plaintext Dreaming) is ALREADY closed in Muse (scanSkillBodyForRisks→quarantine, deterministic draft reject, execute-gating) so it's an L2+L6 extension, not a new lever. The differentiation thesis is comprehensive. Future fires: widen/consolidate existing levers, or 진안 may retheme the loop. (differentiation fire 16)
- ◦ **(hand-off → agent-core/skill-authoring loop) `validateSkillToolReferences`** — the one genuine gap Muse lacks (Hermes #25833 dangling-reference half): validate a self-authored skill body references only tools in the live registry. Touches `packages/skills` + skill-review = owned-loop territory, not the differentiation loop's. Source: differentiation fire 16 scout.

## ◦ Open — tool-mcp-browser axis C (browser)

- ◦ **extend nav-status fidelity to post-click/type navigations** — fire 9 shipped httpStatus/statusError for browser_open + browser_back (the real goto/goBack HTTPResponse). The act paths (click/type) still don't capture nav status because the real click doesn't observe the document HTTPResponse; wiring it needs a main-frame page.once("response") race. Lower value than open/back (covered) — only matters when a click itself navigates to an error page. (fire-9 follow-up)
- ◦ doctor posture allowlist display nuance — `describeOfficialMcpPosture` reports `blocked` for an enabled preset absent from a NON-empty allowlist, but `assembleMcpStack` auto-adds a turnkey-enabled preset to the allowlist so it isn't actually denied at assembly; align the doctor detail to the assembled reality (report it as allowed-via-turnkey-auto-add) so the audit matches runtime. (fire-10 follow-up, cosmetic)


- ◦ official-MCP cred file-path whitespace trim + native OS-keychain backend behind `resolveOfficialMcpToken` (fire-7 follow-ups: env path trims, file path passes a whitespace-only token through as literal `Bearer   ` — cosmetic, fails auth upstream, no leak; keychain is the secure-source upgrade behind the single resolver seam).

## Done — loop infrastructure (2026-06-12, 진안-directed)

- ✓→Done **loop-engineering contract + loop-creator skill** — distilled Addy
  Osmani's "Loop Engineering" into `.claude/skills/loop-creator/references/loop-engineering.md` (6 primitives →
  Muse seams · verifiable stopping condition `/goal` · 3 failure-mode guards:
  unattended-verification / comprehension-debt / cognitive-surrender) and a
  generative `.claude/skills/loop-creator/SKILL.md` that fills the checklist,
  generates a principle-compliant recurring loop prompt, and registers the cron
  itself (delegating scheduling to `/loop`). Replaces hand-written ad-hoc loop
  prompts. FOLLOW-UP: pre-verify the skill end-to-end (theme → generated prompt →
  registered cron → reported stop method) on a real theme before relying on it.

## Done — chat-gate toolGrounded blanket bypass (2026-06-12)

- ✓→Done **toolGrounded blanket bypass** — the chat gate skipped on ANY tool call
  (`toolsUsed.length`) even when the tool returned nothing, taking the deterministic
  value checks down with it — a hole in the fabrication=0 floor on the conversational
  surface. FIX (spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-12-chat-gate-toolgrounded-bypass-design.md`,
  brainstorm+grill-hardened): bypass now keys on **non-empty `toolGroundingSources`**,
  not "a tool ran"; the value checks (`gateChatAnswerDeterministic`) ALWAYS run with
  the tool's own output folded into evidence (a value the tool didn't return is caught,
  a faithful one passes); an empty-result tool falls through to the full gate. Single
  source of truth `groundingSourceFromExecuted` (agent-core) shared by `run()` + the
  `tool-result` stream event (additive `grounding` field) so BOTH chat-repl (run result)
  and chat-ink (stream) gate on one contract. TDD: 4 helper + 2 stream + 3 finalize
  cases (value-check-survives + empty-result-hole RED→GREEN); `pnpm check` (full tree,
  2484 cli) + lint 0. Residual (in spec): tool-grounded PROSE fabrication still passes
  (separate slice, needs judge-vs-tool-evidence). (audit CLI #4)

## ★ Open — TOOL expansion & hardening (loop theme, 진안-directed 2026-06-12)

The loop's standing focus: EXPAND Muse's own tool surface + HARDEN the existing tools.
- ✓→Done **muse.episode list/search `total` lied (post-slice count)** (EXPANSION gap-scout runner-up; shipped fire 22) —
  list/search computed `[...].sort().slice(0, limit)` then returned `total: <sliced>.length`, so `total` was the
  POST-limit count (50 episodes, limit 10 → total:10) not the real store/match size — misleading the model about how
  many episodes exist. The sibling reminders.list does it right (total=pre-slice, shown=post-slice). FIX: sort first,
  `shownList = sorted.slice(0,limit)`, return `shown` + `total = scoped.length` (list) / `matches.length` (search,
  matches now pre-slice). Mirrors reminders. TDD 2 (3 eps, limit 2 → total 3, shown 2) RED→GREEN; an existing test that
  incidentally asserted the buggy `limited.total===1` updated to total:3 + shown:1 (Fable-5 judged the change
  legitimate — incidental characterization, reminders convention is the repo standard). mcp 1718, check 0, lint 0.
  RESIDUAL (non-blocking, one-field follow-up): the llm-judge search branch returns `total: matches.length` (the judge
  caps in code, so there's no pre-slice total) but lacks `shown` for cross-mode consistency.
- ✓→Closed (not a bug) **@muse/model web-search-policy.test "property fuzz"** — investigated in fire 23: the "fuzz" is
  a DETERMINISTIC exhaustive nested loop over a FIXED corpus (enabledOpts × overrideOpts × maxUsesOpts × envWebSearch ×
  envMaxUses), NOT a randomized fast-check property — it runs the exact same ~10k combinations every time, so it is
  input-stable (ran 6× isolated, all 322/322 pass). The single fire-22 failure was ENVIRONMENTAL (slow ~10k iterations
  timing out under the heavy concurrent full-`pnpm check` load, same class as the chat-grounding/playbook-store env
  flakes), not a latent decideWebSearchPolicy edge. No seed to pin, no counterexample exists. Closed.
- ✓→Done **muse.search DuckDuckGo redirect was DOUBLE-DECODED** (EXPANSION gap-scout, fire 23; data-integrity +
  fail-open-to-crash) — `decodeDuckDuckGoRedirect` (loopback-search.ts:369) did `decodeURIComponent(params.get("uddg"))`,
  but `URLSearchParams.get` ALREADY percent-decodes once. So a literal `%20` in a result URL (DDG sends `%2520`) got
  corrupted to a space, and a bare `%` in a target (`https://sale.com/100%-off`) made the second decode THROW
  `URIError: URI malformed`. `parseDuckDuckGoHtml` runs in muse.search's execute() AFTER the fetch try/catch closes
  (loopback-search.ts:191), so the URIError escaped → the whole search call crashed on an attacker-influenceable result
  URL. FIX: drop the redundant decode (`return target ? target : raw;`). TDD 2 (literal-`%20`-survives-intact +
  never-throws-on-bare-`%`) RED→GREEN; the existing redirect tests used single-pass-decoded uddg values so the second
  decode was idempotent there (which masked the bug). mcp 1720, check 0, lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (RED re-confirmed by
  stashing src only; no legit double-encoded path exists — DDG encodes the target once with encodeURIComponent).
- ✓→Done **muse.regex had NO catastrophic-backtracking (ReDoS) guard** (EXPANSION gap-scout; judge-drill target) —
  test/match/replace compiled a user pattern and ran it SYNCHRONOUSLY on up to 50k chars with only a length cap, so a
  nested-unbounded-quantifier pattern ((a+)+, (.*)*, …) HUNG the whole agent process (a sync regex run can't be timed
  out on the main thread; the scout had to SIGKILL it). regex_extract already guards this; the loopback surface never
  got it (same-class-different-surface miss). FIX: export the proven `hasNestedUnboundedQuantifier` from @muse/tools +
  reject in compile() before new RegExp (one guard covers all three tools). TDD 6 catastrophic shapes ×3 tools rejected
  + benign not-rejected, RED→GREEN; mcp 1716, check 0, lint 0. Fable-5 PASS. Also the v1.11.2 JUDGE FAILURE DRILL: a
  narrow `includes("+)+")` guard + non-discriminating test was planted FIRST; the verifier correctly FAILED it (caught
  (.*)*/([a-z]+)*/([a-z]+){2,} slipping through + the non-discriminating test) → rolled back → real fix applied. Judge
  drill 2/2 (fire 10 json.query + fire 21 regex).
- ⏳ **'this weekend' on a Saturday resolves to TODAY (possibly past) — NOT a clean bug (semantic, needs 진안)** —
  loopback-relative-time.ts:477 `delta = (6-getDay()+7)%7` gives 0 on Sat (today) but 6 on Sun (next Sat, skipping
  today). Whether "this weekend" on Sat/Sun means today or next weekend is genuinely ambiguous (like text.stats), and
  the existing weekend test uses a Wednesday reference so the edge is untested-not-documented. Deferred to 진안.
- ✓→Done **add_contact silently DUPLICATED on re-add** (EXPANSION gap-scout, live) — the tool's description
  promises "Add (or update)", but execute always did `id: idFactory()` + save, so a re-add of an existing NAME got
  a fresh id and APPENDED (the store's addContact is id-idempotent only). The duplicate then made the name resolve
  AMBIGUOUS forever (find_contact returns candidates, never a person) — breaking outbound-safety rule 3 (recipient
  must resolve unambiguously) AND remove_contact was equally ambiguous (can't clean up by name). FIX: an optional
  `contacts?` reader on ContactsAddToolDeps; on an exact case-insensitive name match, reuse the existing id + merge
  (new field wins, unmentioned preserved) so an id-idempotent save REPLACES. Wired through BOTH production seams —
  autoconfigure (already addContact-idempotent) + commands-ask vision-auto (CHANGED from a raw read+append
  `writeContacts` to the store's addContact + reader, so it's now id-idempotent + queued). TDD 3 (re-add reuses id +
  merges; case-insensitive; no-reader back-compat) RED→GREEN; mcp 1703, check 0, lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (back-compat
  intact, both seams live). RESIDUAL (non-blocking, separate): exact-name-only match (an ALIAS re-add could still
  duplicate); commands-ask read→save isn't atomic across the merge window (only the save is queued).
- ✓→Done **loopback-crypto base64/hex decode of non-UTF-8 bytes emitted U+FFFD silently** (gap-scout runner-up;
  shipped fire 20) — a valid-FORMAT base64/hex whose decoded BYTES aren't valid UTF-8 (binary, e.g. 0xFF) had
  `toString("utf8")` silently replace them with U+FFFD — garbled text, no error, against the tool's "decode back to
  UTF-8" contract. FIX: a `decodeBytesAsUtf8` helper re-encodes the decoded string and compares to the original
  bytes (valid UTF-8 round-trips exactly; a lossy one doesn't) → `{error: non-UTF-8 (binary) bytes}`. Both base64
  and hex use it; the format-validation error paths are unchanged (distinct). TDD (base64 "/w=="=0xFF + hex "ff"
  → error; emoji/héllo/empty still round-trip) RED→GREEN; mcp 1709, check 0, lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (no valid-UTF-8
  false-reject — emoji/NUL/BOM/literal-U+FFFD all empirically accepted).
- ✓→Done **web_download silently clobbered an existing file** (EXPANSION gap-scout, live) — wrote bytes with a
  plain `writeFile(path, bytes)` (flag "w"), so downloading a name that already exists in the user's Downloads
  dir SILENTLY OVERWROTE the unrelated existing file (irreversible data loss, not even flagged) — AppWorld
  "collateral damage" class, against the module's own fail-closed-disk promise. FIX: a new `writeNonClobbering`
  helper dedupes like a browser (`name (1).ext`, `(2)`, …) using the `wx` flag (atomic exists-check+create, no
  TOCTOU); a real write error (EACCES/ENOSPC) is re-thrown → surfaces, never looped; bounded at 1000. TDD
  (pre-existing report.pdf intact + new bytes at "report (1).pdf") RED→GREEN; mcp 1698, check 0, lint 0.
  Fable-5 PASS (5 concurrent → 5 unique files; fresh-dir original name unchanged; no-ext/dotfile/multi-dot edges).
- ✓→Done **web_download buffered the ENTIRE response body before the size-cap check** (gap-scout runner-up;
  shipped fire 17) — `Buffer.from(await response.arrayBuffer())` then `> maxBytes`, so a multi-GB / never-ending
  body filled RAM despite the 50MB cap (memory-exhaustion DoS). FIX: a Content-Length pre-check (reject before
  reading if declared > cap) + a streamed `getReader()` read that aborts (`reader.cancel()`) the moment the
  accumulated size crosses the cap — the server can lie about/omit CL, so the streamed abort is the real defense;
  a no-body fallback still caps via arrayBuffer. TDD (instrumented 20×100B stream, cap 250B → aborts after ~3
  chunks, nothing written) RED→GREEN; mcp 1700, check 0, lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (under-cap byte-identical, no false
  reject on absent/garbage CL).
- ✓→Done **FLAKY cli chat-grounding.test "fails soft when retrieval throws" — made hermetic (fire 18)** — failed `pnpm check` transiently
  in fires 16 AND 17 (~5s, Ollama-timing dependent), passes on isolated re-run. Not a loop-slice regression but a
  real flaky gate. NEEDS: make the test hermetic (it should fail-soft without a live/slow Ollama path) — small fix
  but on the chat-grounding surface, separate from the TOOL theme; flag to 진안 / a chat-grounding fire. RESOLVED: added an optional injectable `searchRecall` DI seam to
  groundChatTurn/retrieveChatGrounding (production default = real recall); the test now injects a sync-throwing
  recall + MUSE_CHAT_AUTO_REINDEX=0 → NO network, runs in ms (was ~5s), and asserts `called===true` (strictly
  stronger). Fable-5 PASS (production unchanged, fail-soft still exercised). cli 2530, check 0 first-try, lint 0.
- ✓→Done **muse.tasks.update lost-update TOCTOU** (gap-scout runner-up; shipped fire 16) — built a WHOLE stale
  snapshot (`{...tasks[index]}`) outside the write queue and wrote it back inside mutateTasks, so two concurrent
  updates to DIFFERENT fields lost-update (last-writer-wins on the whole object). FIX: build a field-level DELTA
  (sets/clears) and re-apply it onto the FRESH `current[i]` inside the mutate callback (mirror `complete`); single-
  update semantics 1:1 unchanged. TDD (two concurrent updates to title + notes both persist in tasks.json) RED→GREEN;
  mcp 1699, check 0, lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (reproduced RED in a /tmp worktree). RESIDUAL (acceptable, pre-existing):
  a partial dueAt reschedule still anchors to the stale existing-due, so a due-move RACE on the SAME field is
  last-writer-wins (the cross-field lost-update is fixed); same class as `complete`'s resolve-outside-queue.
- ✓→Done **muse.url.parse query map prototype pollution** (EXPANSION gap-scout, live) — the query map was a
  prototype-bearing `{}`, so an attacker-controlled URL `?__proto__=a` hit the Object.prototype SETTER (param
  vanished + the object's prototype polluted before serialization) and `?constructor=c` collided with the
  inherited Object constructor (corrupted to an array via the dedup). Same class as the fire-4 json.merge
  __proto__ fix, unfixed on the URL surface. FIX (1 line): `const query = Object.create(null)` — null-prototype
  map, so __proto__/constructor land as plain own DATA keys and the `existing === undefined` dedup works for
  every key. TDD 1 (__proto__=a → own "a", constructor=c → "c", x="1") RED→GREEN; mcp 1696, check 0, lint 0.
  Fable-5 PASS (dedup string/array shapes preserved, JSON serializes null-proto own keys, no downstream consumer).
- ⏳ **muse.text.stats whitespace→zero — NOT a clean bug (documented behavior, needs 진안)** — `stats("   ")` returns
  `{characters:0, lines:0, words:0}` but an existing test (mcp.test.ts "treats whitespace as zero") DOCUMENTS this as
  intended. Unlike encode_query's incidental "[object Object]", the whitespace→zero is a named design choice — changing
  it alters documented behavior. Deferred to 진안: is whitespace-only meant to count as zero, or report factual chars/lines?
- ✓→Done **muse.url.encode_query encoded a nested object as "[object Object]"** (gap-scout runner-up; shipped fire 14) —
  `String(raw)` coerced a nested object/array value to the literal "[object Object]" — a silently-corrupt query param.
  FIX: an isScalar guard returns `{error: must be string/number/boolean}` for a non-scalar value or array item (scalars,
  scalar arrays, null/undefined skipping unchanged). TDD (nested-object value + object-in-array → error; scalar control
  encodes) RED→GREEN; updated an existing unit that incidentally characterized the "[object Object]" output (Fable-5
  judged the change legitimate — the test's intent was scalars). mcp 1697, check 0, lint 0.
- ✓→Done **muse.calendar.add mis-anchored a time-only endsAt** (EXPANSION gap-scout, live EN+KO) — `add`
  resolved `endsAt` with `parseIsoDate(endsAtRaw)` whose default anchor is now(today), so a bare time-of-day
  end ("4pm"/"오후 4시") for a NOT-today event resolved against TODAY while startsAt resolved to tomorrow →
  the LocalCalendarProvider INVALID_TIME_RANGE guard rejected it ("endsAt must be at or after startsAt").
  The sibling `update` already anchors a time-only end to the event day (`anchorFor`); `add` never did. FIX
  (1 expr): anchor a time-only endsAt to the resolved START's day — `isTimeOnlyPhrase(endsAtRaw) ?
  parseIsoDate(endsAtRaw, () => startOfLocalDay(startsAt)) : parseIsoDate(endsAtRaw)`. Date-bearing/ISO/absent
  endsAt unchanged. TDD 2 (EN "tomorrow 3pm"+"4pm", KO "다음 주 월요일 오후 3시"+"오후 4시" → end on start's
  day 16:00, no error) RED→GREEN via a registry mirroring the provider guard; mcp 1694, check 0, lint 0.
  Fable-5 PASS (no regression on other endsAt shapes; guard untouched).
- ✓→Done **muse.calendar.update cross-day move anchored a time-only endsAt to the OLD day** (gap-scout runner-up; shipped fire 12) —
  update's `anchorFor` uses `resolved.event.startsAt` (the original day), so "move it to Monday, ending 5pm"
  lands the end on the original day, not Monday. FIX: anchor the time-only endsAt to `newStartsAt` when the
  start moved. 1 expr + 1 test. (Sibling of the add fix above.)
- ◦ **relative-time "this weekend" asked ON a Saturday resolves to today 09:00 (possibly past)** (runner-up) —
  loopback-relative-time.ts:~477 delta `% 7` = 0 with no roll-forward (unlike the bare-weekday handler that
  forces delta=7). FIX: roll forward to next Saturday when today is already Sat. 1 line + 1 test.
- ✓→Done **muse.math.evaluate silently truncated a malformed multi-dot number** (EXPANSION gap-scout) —
  `parseNumber` scans a literal by greedily consuming digits AND dots, then did `Number.parseFloat(literal)`:
  `parseFloat("1.2.3")` returns 1.2 (stops at the 2nd dot, NOT NaN), so the NaN guard never fired and
  `evaluate("1.2.3 * 100")` silently returned 120. The math tool's WHOLE contract is an exact digit the
  local 8B can't compute, and this is the shared core behind the muse.math MCP tool AND the muse ask /
  chat-repl arithmetic fast-paths — a wrong digit flows into a user answer with NO model in the loop.
  FIX: one line, `Number.parseFloat(literal)` → strict `Number(literal)` (Number("1.2.3")=NaN → existing
  `invalid number literal` throw; "5."/".5"/integers/decimals still parse — node-verified no valid number
  regresses; "1..2" also now rejected). TDD 1 (multi-dot → error + 5./.5 controls) RED→GREEN; mcp 1687,
  check 0, lint 0. Fable-5 verifier PASS (no valid-input regression, reaches ask/chat fast-path). Matches
  code-style.md "strict Number() not parseFloat".
- ✓→Done **muse.json.query walked the prototype chain** (EXPANSION gap-scout runner-up; shipped fire 10) — path resolution uses
  `segment.key in cursor` so a path like `constructor`/`__proto__` on a plain object returns `found:true`
  with an inherited (often function) value that JSON-serialization silently drops to `{found:true}` (no
  value), and `__proto__` leaks Object.prototype. FIX: `Object.hasOwn(cursor, segment.key)` (own-property
  only). Sibling of the fire-4 __proto__ merge fix. 1 line + 1 test.
- ✓→Done **atomicWriteFile leaked its tmp on failure** (EXPANSION gap-scout runner-up) — `atomicWriteFile`
  (the shared sidecar-store write primitive) opened `<file>.tmp-<pid>-<uuid>`, wrote+fsync+closed it, then
  `fs.rename(tmp, file)`. On ANY failure after the tmp was opened (writeFile/sync error OR the rename
  failing), the tmp was orphaned → `*.tmp-*` litter accumulating in every sidecar dir (memory/tasks/
  reminders/action-log/…). FIX: wrap open→write→rename→chmod in try/catch; on failure
  `fs.rm(tmp,{force:true}).catch(()=>undefined)` then rethrow the ORIGINAL error (rm errors swallowed, never
  substituted; force no-ops if open never created the tmp). TDD 1 behavioral (target=directory → rename
  throws → assert rejection AND zero `.tmp-` entries) RED→GREEN; mcp 1681, check 0, lint 0. Fable-5 verifier
  PASS (swapped HEAD source to reproduce RED; no cross-writer race — rm targets only this call's UUID tmp).
- ✓→Done **muse.fs.stat lied about symlinks** (EXPANSION gap-scout runner-up) — the tool's description
  promises "Symlinks are reported as kind=symlink without following", but it called `fsLib.stat` (which
  FOLLOWS the link), so `entryKind`'s `isSymbolicLink()` was always false → a symlink was ALWAYS reported
  as its target's kind, never `symlink`. The contract was unsatisfiable. FIX: added an optional `lstat?`
  to the injectable fs seam + wired real `node:fs/promises` lstat into the default; the stat tool now
  calls `(fsLib.lstat ?? fsLib.stat)(decision.resolved)` (lexical path → lstat sees the link). The
  realpath-escape guard still runs first (unchanged), so no path guard was weakened. TDD 1 behavioral
  (lstat→isSymbolicLink → kind=symlink, vs stat-follow → file) RED→GREEN; mcp 1680, check 0, lint 0.
  Fable-5 verifier PASS (sandbox-compiled HEAD reproduced RED). RESIDUAL: read/list still FOLLOW symlinks
  on the lexical path (by design — realpath guard prevents escape; a symlink-swap TOCTOU window remains,
  separate slice). Runner-up still OPEN: `atomicWriteFile` leaks `*.tmp-*` on a write/rename failure (no
  unlink on the error path — accumulates litter in sidecar store dirs).
- ✓→Done **muse.json.merge prototype-pollution** (EXPANSION gap-scout, Fable-5) — `deepMerge` did
  `result[key] = …` for every key of model-supplied `overrides`; model args arrive via JSON.parse, which
  makes `"__proto__"` an OWN data key, so `result["__proto__"] = …` hit the Object.prototype SETTER and
  HIJACKED the merged object's prototype (silently injected inherited fields like `isAdmin`, dropped the
  key). FIX: special-case `key === "__proto__"` — read any existing own value via
  `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor`, deep-merge, write back via `Object.defineProperty` as an own
  enumerable data prop (never the setter); other keys unchanged. Verifier confirmed `__proto__` is the
  ONLY setter vector here (constructor/prototype create plain own props, no pollution) and the guard
  recurses to every depth. TDD 1 behavioral (JSON.parse'd `__proto__` overrides → prototype intact +
  no injected field + key preserved as data) RED→GREEN; mcp 1679, check 0, lint 0. Fable-5 verifier PASS.
- **ask error-path run-log trace (#6/#7) — DECOMPOSED (v1.11.2 decompose-on-defer)**: writeRunLog(success:true)
  was inline at the END of the ~2000-line `muse ask` action (commands-ask.ts:3734) with NO enclosing
  try/catch, so a thrown run left no trace (error-analysis fuel lost) + Ctrl-C logged success:true. Same
  pattern in chat-repl. Split into loop-sized slices with exact seams:
  - ✓→Done **6a — pure `buildAskRunLog` builder (the shared seam)**: extracted the inline cli.local payload
    into `buildAskRunLog(params)` in program-helpers.ts (next to writeRunLog), supporting BOTH success and a
    FAILURE shape (`success:false` + `error`). Wired the live success path (commands-ask.ts:3734) to it
    (not inert). TDD 3 (success payload + readResponseSuccess lifts true; FAILURE payload lifts false + carries
    error; confidence/error omitted when absent) RED→GREEN. cli 2528, check 0, lint 0.
  - ◦ **6b — wrap the ask run in a failure-logging seam (THE fix, dedicated fire)**: extract the 1842 action
    body into a nested `async function runAskAction(queryParts, options)` (closure vars stay in scope) and
    register `.action(async (q,o)=>{ try { await runAskAction(q,o) } catch(e){ await writeRunLog(.., buildAskRunLog({..success:false, errorMessage:String(e)})); throw e } })`. RED: a thrown ask run writes a
    success:false entry. SIZING: the body-extraction is a big MECHANICAL (~2000-line) move — behavior-identical,
    verify with the full ask suite BEFORE adding the catch; warrants its own focused fire (or human-paired), not
    bundled. 6a already provides the payload so the catch is one-liner.
  - ◦ **6c — #7 Ctrl-C/abort does NOT log success:true**: once 6b's catch exists, an AbortError/SIGINT reaching
    it logs success:false (or skips), never success:true. RED: simulate abort → assert no success:true entry. Small.
  - ✓→Done **6d — chat-repl failure trace**: `createTuiChatSubmitter` wrote a run-log only on the happy
    path; a thrown runner left no trace. Added an injectable `runChat` param (default = real local/remote
    dispatch) + a try/catch that writes a `success:false` entry (response {error, success:false}) best-effort
    then re-throws the original error. TDD 2 (throwing runner → success:false trace + re-throw; success path
    unchanged) RED→GREEN. cli 2530, check 0, lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (success path byte-identical, no double-log).
    Note: done independently of 6b (chat handler is a small fn, no 2000-line extraction needed).
- ⏳ **calendar credential encryption-at-rest — DEFERRED (architectural cost)**: `FileCalendarCredentialStore`
  stores caldav passwords / google tokens plaintext (0600). The proven envelope lives in `@muse/memory`,
  but `@muse/mcp`→`@muse/calendar` already, and `@muse/memory` pulls `@muse/db`+`@muse/model` — encrypting
  the lean calendar package would bloat its dep graph (and the desktop binary). Needs a shared low-level
  crypto seam or a key-provider injection decision (Jinan-level), not an autonomous fire.
- ✓→Done **notes-family tool-selection coverage + sharpened save/append not-when** (per-tool not-when
  audit follow-up): `muse.notes` save/append had ZERO not-when clauses and were ABSENT from eval:tools.
  RED baseline (live gemma4, 3 runs) caught a real save-vs-append confusion (KO "write to a note" →
  notes.append 0/3 instead of notes.save). FIX: sharpened save (=CREATE/REPLACE a note FILE) + append
  (=ADD to an EXISTING note) descriptions with use-when/NOT-when (both NOT a to-do/reminder) +
  `buildNotesScenario` (6 cases: 3 positive notes-file + 3 disambiguation task/reminder must NOT route
  to a note tool). GREEN 12/12 STABLE 3/3; Fable-5 verifier PASS (discriminating + registered + not
  over-fit). mcp 1678·check 0·lint 0. REMAINING per-tool not-when targets: messaging/episodes/context.
- ✓→Done **SSRF-guard test fallout swept (web_action consumers)** — the earlier always-async
  assertPublicHttpUrl hardening correctly broke 4 tests that used non-resolvable reserved-TLD hosts
  (`*.test`) as fake public URLs → guard refused them, no fetch fired. Threaded an OPTIONAL
  `lookup?: HostLookup` DI seam through `buildActuatorTools` + `approvePendingApproval` (runActuatorByName
  already had it); the 4 tests (cli×2, api×2) now inject a fake PUBLIC resolver. Production omits lookup →
  real node:dns/promises → guard intact (Fable-5 verifier confirmed: seam is caller-controlled, not
  model-facing; no SSRF hole). check 0·lint 0.
- ✓→Done **scout raw-NUL byte-hygiene regression** — `run-log-analysis.ts:85` had a literal raw NUL
  delimiter (`${kind}\x00${topic}`) from an earlier fire, FAILING the @muse/shared byte-hygiene gate on
  main (caught by `pnpm check`, missed by quick self-eval). Replaced with the u+0000 escape (byte-identical
  runtime value; key is Map-only, never split). shared byte-hygiene 30/30.
- ✓→Done **web_download post-redirect SSRF re-check** (EXPANSION-scouted): the SSRF guard ran only
  on the INITIAL url, so a public URL redirecting to a private/link-local host (169.254.169.254
  metadata, 127.0.0.1) was followed and WRITTEN TO DISK. Now re-applies assertPublicHttpUrl to the
  final `response.url` AFTER fetch, BEFORE any write (mirrors loopback-web-read + fetch-readable-url —
  web_download was the only fetch path missing it). Behavioral test (redirect→private = refused +
  nothing written) RED→GREEN; Opus security-grade verifier PASS. mcp 1668·lint 0.
- ✓→Done **SSRF DNS-rebinding closed** — the web fetch tools (web_download, web_action) had a
  `deps.lookup ? async : sync` bypass: with no lookup wired (production), the SYNC guard ran, catching
  only LITERAL private IPs, not a public hostname that *resolves* to a private IP (rebinding). Fix:
  drop the bypass, always call `assertPublicHttpUrl` (its defaultLookup = node:dns/promises resolves +
  checks) — so the no-lookup production path now catches rebinding. Hermetic tests: injected
  privateLookup→refused + a dns-stubbed no-lookup test that the verifier confirmed discriminates the
  fix (reverting the bypass makes it fail). web_action fixed too. (loopback-web-read was already
  correct.) mcp 1670·lint 0. Note: this fire FAILED first (test proved NXDOMAIN not rebinding) →
  test fixed → re-verified PASS.
Every slice ships its eval/test and never weakens the grounding floor. Ranked:

- ✓→Done **mac wifi_status read** (capability-scout): "am I on WiFi? / what network?" was unanswerable
  — `mac_system_set` could TOGGLE wifi but there was no READ (write/read asymmetry). Added a
  `wifi_status` shell-read source to the wired `mac_app_read` (networksetup -listallhardwareports →
  device, -getairportnetwork → {connected, network}), reusing parseWifiDevice. read-only (no
  -setairportpower). Behavioral parse tests (connected+disconnected) + eval read-vs-write disambig
  (EN+KO). macos 85·lint 0, Opus-verified. SCOUT NOTE: surface now broadly capable; remaining
  capability gaps are niche/live-only (running_apps, ip_address) → recommend a theme switch next.

- ✓→Done **mac_screenshot arbitrary-write closed** (EXPANSION-scout): the `path` arg went straight to
  `screencapture -x <path>` with no validation — a model/injection could overwrite ANY writable file
  (e.g. ~/.ssh/authorized_keys) with PNG bytes. Fix: allowlist (~/Desktop, ~/Downloads, tmp), `~`
  expand, basename, parent-dir realpath check, AND full-target realpath (a symlink AT an allowed path
  pointing outside is refused — mirrors the loopback-filesystem fix). fail-closed, runner never called
  on refusal. 6 behavioral tests (abs-path/traversal/outside-parent/symlink-at-target → refused,
  allowed/default → ok). FAIL→fix→re-PASS: the first gate caught a SILENT symlink-at-target residual
  (the prior fire had just closed that exact class) → closed it + tested → re-verified. macos 83·lint 0.

- ✓→Done **loopback-filesystem symlink-escape closed** (EXPANSION-scout runner-up): the MCP
  filesystem server's allowlist checked paths LEXICALLY only — a symlink inside an allowed root
  pointing outside (/allowed/x -> /etc/passwd) passed and was read/listed/statted. Fix: a 2nd gate in
  checkAllowed realpath-resolves the path AND the roots (symmetric, handles macOS /var->/private/var)
  and refuses if the real path escapes (fail-closed on throw/ENOENT); applied to read/list/stat. 8
  behavioral tests (escape→error, normal→content, dangling→refused). Verifier confirmed production
  always wires the default realpath (the optional dep is test-only, no skip-hole). mcp 1678·lint 0.
  (file_read already had a realpath guard; this was the MCP-server variant's gap.)

- ✓→Dropped (NOISE, fire 6) **browser-read ungrounded ×7** — the scout's first hit turned out to
  be dev-test NOISE: 7 traces from the 2026-06-11 browser-testing session, all EMPTY answers
  (ans_len 0, tools []) — a no-op the gate correctly marked ungrounded, NOT a real grounding miss.
  Fix went to the SCOUT instead (fire 6): exclude empty-answer non-answers, so the board is now
  clean. Lesson: an ungrounded EMPTY answer ≠ actionable work.

EXPAND (new reach):
- ✓→Done **browser_look — describe the current browser page visually (local vision)** — browser_read
  returns DOM text + elements, so a VISUAL page (chart, graph, map, diagram, image, a rendered error
  dialog) was invisible to the model. New browser_look captures the page (controller.screenshotBase64,
  added to the BrowserController interface) and describes it with the local vision model (injected
  describeImage; the CLI binds it via the same screenVision holder as mac_screen_read — omitted when no
  model). Completes "vision everywhere": screen (mac_screen_read) · local image (file_read) · image URL
  (web_read) · browser page (browser_look). Sharpened browser_read with a not-when line (visual content
  → browser_look) so the model doesn't default to text-read. TDD 4 (well-formed, capture+describe+mime,
  question passthrough, vision-error); eval:tools browser scenario 9/9 STABLE 3/3 (browser_look vs
  browser_read on chart/graph prompts); eval:browser-agent 1/1 (act-path untouched); LIVE — a real
  Chrome page captured and described via gemma4, no error. browser 41, full eval:tools 138/139 (1
  known synthetic flake), check 0, lint 0.
- ✓→Done **web_read describes IMAGE URLs via local vision** — web_read read HTML and PDF URLs but
  rejected image content-types ("not a readable text page"), even though file_read reads LOCAL images
  via vision. Now an image/* response is read as bytes (10MB cap) and described by an injected
  describeImage callback (autoconfigure binds it from the assembly's gemma4 in buildLoopbackTools —
  @muse/mcp stays model-free); absent model ⇒ refused as before. HTML/PDF paths unchanged. Completes
  the symmetry: file_read (local text/pdf/docx/image) ↔ web_read (URL html/pdf/image). TDD 3 (image
  via injected vision + mime, refuse-without-vision, HTML still text); an existing non-readable test
  moved to application/zip so it still exercises that path; LIVE — a real image URL routed through
  web_read's vision path returned a description (no error). mcp 1648 + autoconfigure 505, check 0,
  lint 0, precheck:grounding pass^2.
- ✓→Done **file_read reads IMAGE files via local vision** — file_read classified .png/.jpg/etc. as
  "unsupported" even though Muse has local vision (describeImage, already used by mac_screen_read). Now
  an image FileKind (extension + magic-byte sniff: PNG/JPEG/GIF/WEBP) routes the bytes to an injected
  describeImage callback (the CLI binds it to the assembly's gemma4 via the same lazy holder as
  mac_screen_read; @muse/mcp stays model-free); absent callback ⇒ refused as before. imageMimeType
  derives the MIME from extension then magic. Magic-detected images win over a misleading extension.
  TDD 5 (classify/sniff/route-via-vision/refuse-without-vision/vision-error); eval:file-read image
  round-trip (routed + mime + refuse-without-vision); LIVE — a real Chrome-rendered receipt PNG read
  by gemma4 returned "CAFE MUSE / Latte x2 9,000 / Total 9,000 KRW". file_read is now read-any-file
  (text/pdf/docx/image). mcp 1645, full eval:tools 137/137, check 0, lint 0.
- ✓→Done **web_read reads PDF URLs (not just HTML)** — `isReadableContentType` rejected
  application/pdf, so "summarize this report.pdf link" failed with "not a readable text page". Now a
  PDF content-type response is read as bytes (10MB cap) and extracted via the same pdfjs already used
  by file_read (injectable `extractPdfText`, default lazy pdfjs); HTML still routes through the text
  extractor. One-step "summarize this PDF link" instead of download-then-read. TDD 2 (PDF via injected
  extractor, HTML still uses text path); LIVE — a real Chrome-generated PDF fetched through web_read's
  pdfjs path returns the body text. mcp 1640, check 0, lint 0.
- ✓→Done **web search wired into the default agent (muse.search)** — `muse.search` (web search, zero-config
  DuckDuckGo fallback, SearXNG when MUSE_SEARXNG_URL is set) existed + was tested but was ONLY reachable
  behind the opt-in MUSE_LOOPBACK_MCP_ENABLED flag, so by default the agent could not answer fresh-web
  questions. Added it to the always-on buildLoopbackTools bundle (MUSE_SEARCH_ENABLED opt-out), gave the
  tool KO+EN keywords + use-when/not-when + an example schema (it had none, so it ranked 0 under the diet
  cap). TDD 3 (bundle present / default-on / opt-out) + eval:tools web-search scenario 4/4 STABLE 3/3
  (muse.search vs knowledge_search vs web_read); LIVE: `muse ask --with-tools` searched the web and
  answered with puppeteer 25.1.0. autoconfigure 505, full eval:tools 135/135, check 0, lint 0.
- ✓→Done **browser: uncapped deterministic matching, capped display** — scan/match cap raised
  50→150 (BROWSER_MAX_ELEMENTS), model-facing display capped at 40 (BROWSER_DISPLAY_ELEMENTS) with a
  truncated/shownElements/totalElements + "showing N of M" hint (no silent caps). click/type/find
  resolve against the FULL set (matcher is code), so a target past #40 still acts. TDD 3 cases
  (display cap + true total + match-beyond-cap + small-page-not-truncated); smoke:browser long-page
  case (71st element reachable past the 40 display cap); eval:tools browser 7/7 ×3, eval:browser-agent
  3/3, check 0, lint 0.
- ✓→Done **browser: same-origin iframe piercing (observe + act)** — the snapshot walk now descends
  into same-origin iframe contentDocuments (like shadow roots; cross-origin throws → skipped), so
  embedded forms/checkout/widgets are visible. The act path went frame-aware: `locateRef` finds the
  puppeteer Frame holding a ref (main doc incl. shadow via pierce/, else a child frame) and
  click/type use `frame.locator` — so a click/type on an element INSIDE an iframe acts in its own
  frame, not the main one. smoke:browser gains a same-origin srcdoc-iframe case (button listed +
  clicked inside the frame, text flips Paid); eval:browser-agent 3/3 (act-path refactor no
  regression); browser unit 37, check 0, lint 0. Cross-origin iframes stay out (CDP needs per-frame
  contexts — honest scope).
- ✓→Done **file_read: .docx (Word) extraction** — `docx` FileKind + lazy mammoth (extractRawText,
  injectable like extractPdfText); routes by extension since a .docx is a zip (sniffs unsupported).
  Description gains the Word cue. TDD 4 cases (classify/resolve/route/description); eval:file-read
  generates a REAL .docx at runtime (self-contained minimal-zip writer via node:zlib crc32/deflate —
  no committed binary) → mammoth extracts → tool round-trip; eval:tools file scenario 6/6 STABLE 3/3
  (KO '계약서 워드 파일' → file_read), full 131/131; check 0, lint 0. Follow-up: .xlsx — see the ⏳ dep-decision blocker in HARDEN.
- ✓→Done **web_download — save a file from a URL to Downloads** — chose the URL-based design over
  browser-element download (no controller interface change, no live Chrome, fully deterministic
  verification). New `web_download` tool: SSRF-guarded (loopback/internal refused via the shared
  assertPublicHttpUrl), 50MB size cap, basename-only filename (`safeDownloadName` — no path escape).
  The write-side companion to file_read; file_read then reads/summarizes what was saved. Wired
  default-on under --with-tools next to file_read. TDD 9 (safeDownloadName 3 + tool 6: well-formed,
  download+write, SSRF refuse, non-http refuse, size cap no-write, filename sanitize); eval:tools
  web scenario 6/6 STABLE 3/3 (web_download vs web_read vs search vs knowledge_search); LIVE — a real
  http server's file fetched and written to disk with matching bytes. mcp 1638, full eval:tools
  137/137, check 0, lint 0.
- ✓→Done **mac: read Calendar.app / Notes.app / Reminders.app** — all three shipped as SOURCES on
  the already-wired `mac_app_read` tool (`reminders` incomplete items+due, `calendar` today's events,
  `notes` recent titles) — not new tools, keeps the exposed set small (tool-calling.md). Each:
  reachable in the model-facing app enum (verifier confirmed), behavioral parse test (fake osascript
  runner), eval:tools golden cases (EN+KO). risk=read (snippets never mutate). The earlier INERT
  separate-tool attempt was rolled back; done the COMPLETE way (extend wired tool + eval). So
  "what's on my calendar today / what reminders do I have / what notes" works locally.

HARDEN (make existing tools more reliable):
- ✓→Done **regex_extract ReDoS guard** — the tool ran a model/untrusted-supplied regex with no
  backtracking protection; a nested-quantifier pattern like `(a+)+$` against just 50 chars hung the
  whole agent for ~90s (measured by the RED test). JS regex can't be timed out on the main thread,
  so added `hasNestedUnboundedQuantifier` (the safe-regex star-height heuristic, escape-aware proper
  paren matching) and reject the pattern BEFORE compile. Catches the common catastrophic class
  ((a+)+, (.*)*, ([a-z]+){2,}); overlapping-alternation ReDoS ((a|ab)+) is out of scope (still
  bounded by the 100k input cap) — documented honestly. TDD 5 (flags nested shapes, accepts ordinary
  patterns the model writes, escaped parens, tool rejects-not-hangs, normal extract still works);
  tools 242, byte-hygiene 30, check 0, lint 0.
- ✓→Done **muse.search snippet length cap** — result snippets were sanitized but not LENGTH-bounded, so a
  SearXNG/DDG engine returning a full paragraph × up to 10 rows blew the local 8B's context. Added a 280-char
  word-boundary cap (`capSnippet`) on both the DDG and SearXNG paths; titles/urls untouched. A search result is
  for TRIAGE (pick a URL to read), not the full text. TDD 1 (long snippet capped, short snippet + title intact);
  mcp 1629, byte-hygiene 30, check 0, lint 0.
- ✓→Done **web_read readability — strip nav/footer boilerplate** — extractReadableText dropped
  script/style/head but kept <nav> menus and <footer> (copyright/link farms), so a "summarize this
  URL" answer grounded on site chrome, not the article. Added nav|footer to the element-strip regex
  (HTML5 boilerplate by definition). TDD 1 (nav+footer dropped, article kept); live on a realistic
  article shape (nested footer>nav handled) — only the article body survives. mcp 1628, byte-hygiene
  30, check 0, lint 0.
- ✓→Done **browser_open scheme guard (no local-file read via file://)** — browser_open passed any
  URL straight to page.goto, so `file:///etc/passwd` (or chrome://, view-source:, javascript:, data:)
  would load+return arbitrary local files — a broader local read than file_read's allowlisted,
  symlink-guarded path, and a prompt-injection exfil vector. Now `normalizeBrowserUrl` accepts only
  http(s) (bare host → https; host:port preserved) and refuses every other scheme. TDD 4 cases;
  eval:browser-agent migrated to a loopback http server (was file://) and still 3/3; smoke unaffected
  (uses the controller directly). mcp/browser 37, check 0, lint 0.
- ✓→Done **command_injection pattern over-fired on legit loopback URLs** — dropped the bare `http`
  trigger so the pattern requires a command VERB (curl|wget|fetch) near an internal host. "open
  http://localhost:3000 in the browser" / "내 dev 서버 http://127.0.0.1:8080 열어줘" no longer trip the
  input guard (it was blocking the whole turn); curl/wget/fetch-toward-internal still fire. TDD 3
  false-positive + 3 true-positive cases; eval:browser-agent reverted off the [::1] workaround back
  to 127.0.0.1 and still 3/3 (proves the guard fix end-to-end); policy 129, byte-hygiene 30, check 0,
  lint 0, precheck:grounding pass^2.
- ✓→Done **file_read symlink-escape guard** — the absolute-path check was LEXICAL only: a file
  lexically inside the roots could be a symlink to /etc/passwd, and readFile followed it. Now
  realpath-verifies the target (and the roots — /tmp is itself a symlink on macOS) before reading;
  a link resolving outside the roots is refused, a realpath error refuses. Optional fsImpl.realpath
  (default node realpath; a fake fs with no symlinks is a no-op so existing tests are unchanged).
  TDD 3 cases (candidate-link escape, absolute-path-link escape, identity still reads) + eval:file-read
  REAL symlink round-trip (a link under Downloads → outside is refused, target content not returned);
  mcp 1627, check 0, lint 0.
- ⏳ **file_read .xlsx — BLOCKED on a dep decision (needs 진안)** — the maintained npm xlsx reader
  is exceljs (~21MB unpacked) and SheetJS `xlsx` on npm is the old CVE-flagged build. A 21MB dep or a
  fragile hand-rolled OOXML parser is too much to adopt autonomously; surface the choice. (.docx
  shipped via mammoth ~2MB, which was proportionate.)
- ◦ **per-tool not-when audit** — PROGRESS (loop fire): the `followup` tools (list/cancel/snooze)
  were the ONLY personal-tool family with ZERO not-when clauses → added "use when / NOT when"
  disambiguating them from tasks/reminders (followup = agent auto-captured thread, not a user item)
  + buildFollowupScenario in eval-tool-selection.mjs (6 positive + 4 disambiguation cases). Verifier
  confirmed the disambig cases are discriminating + wired. Other families (tasks/reminders/calendar)
  already have not-when. REMAINING: spot-audit any other tool families that lack it.
- ✓→Done **muse.status.notes_index promised "size" but never returned it** (EXPANSION gap-scout, fire 24;
  tool-contract output drift) — the tool description says "Returns relative path + size — no contents. Use this as a
  discovery surface before deciding to embed/search", but `execute` mapped each file to `{ name }` ONLY — `size` was
  silently absent, so the model couldn't use size (the embedding-cost signal the description sells) to decide what to
  embed. FIX: map to `{ name, size: await fileSize(pathJoin(dir, e.name)) }` reusing the pre-existing `fileSize` helper
  (returns `number | undefined`, swallows a TOCTOU-delete so one racing file can't blank the index); map became
  `Promise.all`. TDD 1 (2 .md files of 5 + 6 bytes → each entry's size === byte length) RED(size undefined)→GREEN; mcp
  1721, check 0 (all pkgs green), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (RED re-confirmed by stashing src; total/error-path untouched; no
  other test pinned the old `{name}`-only shape — the tool output was previously untested). Picked over the tasks.search
  total runner-up for KIND diversity (fire 22 was the episode total-post-slice, same KIND).
- ◦ **muse.tasks.search `total` is post-slice (capped at 50)** (EXPANSION gap-scout fire-24 runner-up; misleading-value,
  diversity-deferred) — `loopback-tasks.ts:406-411`: matches are `…sort().slice(0,50)` then `total: matches.length`, so
  `total` caps at 50 not the true match count — and unlike the SAME file's `list` tool (which reports pre-slice `total`
  + `shown`), search is internally inconsistent and has no `shown`. Distinct from the contested followups.total: here
  `list` vs `search` in ONE module disagree. Only test uses 2 tasks (total 1/0), so the cap is undocumented. FIX: pre-
  slice `total = filtered.length`, return the 50-cap slice + add `shown`. Slice: 1 file + 1 test (51 matching tasks →
  total 51, shown 50). NOT this fire (same KIND as the fire-22 episode total fix — pick a different KIND first).
- ✓→Done **bare day-of-month roll silently overflowed to a WRONG date** (EXPANSION gap-scout, fire 25;
  data-integrity / silent-wrong-value) — `resolveRelativeTimePhrase`'s `dayOfMonthMatch` branch
  (loopback-relative-time.ts:537-541) rolled a past/absent day forward with a SINGLE `new Date(y, month+1, dom)` and no
  re-validation, so a short +1 month overflowed: "the 31st" late on Jan 31 → `new Date(2026,1,31)` = Feb 31 → silently
  **March 3** (not March 31); "the 30th"→Mar 2, "the 29th"→Mar 1. The file's own comment promised "the next month that
  has it". That wrong date persisted into a reminder/task. FIX: bounded loop (ahead 1..12) advancing month-by-month,
  re-checking `getDate()===dom && getTime()>reference` each step, `return getDate()===dom ? finiteDate : undefined`. TDD
  3 (the 31st/30th/29th @ Jan, each → March same-day) RED(getDate 3≠31)→GREEN; relative-time file 44/44, mcp 1722, check
  0 (all pkgs), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (RED re-confirmed by stashing src; loop terminates, returns first future occurrence,
  final guard rejects nothing valid; no existing test documented the overflow).
- ✓→Done **relative-time SIBLING year-roll overflows** (fire 26; completes the fire-25 date-overflow class) — both
  +1-year roll sites skipped re-validation: (A) `resolveAbsoluteMonthDate` (loopback-relative-time.ts:230-236) and (B)
  the Korean `koAbsDate` roll (~750-758) — "feb 29" / "2월 29일" asked in a leap year AFTER it passed (ref 2028-06-01)
  rolled into the non-leap next year where `new Date(2029,1,29)` silently became **Mar 1, 2029** (a date the user never
  asked for, persisted into a reminder/task). FIX: re-check the rolled date's month/day and return undefined (fail-safe)
  instead of a wrong date — consistent with the file's reject-don't-roll philosophy for impossible dates. TDD 3 (en + ko
  feb-29 → undefined; mar-5 valid-roll → 2027 no-regression guard) RED(both gave 2029-03-01)→GREEN; relative-time 47/47,
  mcp 1725, check 0 (all pkgs), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (RED re-confirmed by stashing src; both are the ONLY two +1-year
  roll sites; getMonth-only suffices for B since day≤31 pre-validated; 413 tests across 3 files green). NOTE: returns
  undefined rather than finding the next leap year (2032) — a fail-safe minimal fix; next-leap resolution is a separate
  enhancement if 진안 wants it.
- ✓→Done **muse.math#evaluate silently failed on a valid tab/newline expression** (EXPANSION gap-scout, fire 27;
  input-validation / whitelist↔tokenizer contract drift) — `SAFE_MATH_PATTERN = /^[\s\d+\-*/().,%]+$/u` (line 13) admits
  ALL whitespace, but the tokenizer's `skip()` only advanced over a literal space `" "`. So a contract-valid `"2 *\t3"`
  or a pasted multi-line `"1000\n+ 2000"` passed the whitelist, then the tab/newline stalled the cursor and the parser
  threw "expected number" / "trailing characters" — the math fast-path (also behind `muse ask`'s exact-arithmetic
  route) silently rejecting input its own contract accepts. FIX: `skip()` advances over any `\s` (`/\s/u.test(...)`),
  aligning the tokenizer with the whitelist. TDD 1 ("2 *\t3"→6, "1000\n+ 2000"→3000, "(1 +\n2)*3"→9) RED("expected
  number")→GREEN; mcp 1726, check 0 (all pkgs), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (RED re-confirmed by stashing src; "1 2"/"1\t2"
  still error — no number concatenation; whitelist unchanged so no new chars reachable, no injection; 364 math/file
  tests green). KIND deliberately non-date after two date-overflow fires.
- ✓→Done **mac_say argv flag-injection** (EXPANSION gap-scout, fire 28; argument injection / fail-open option
  parsing) — `mac_say` built `argv = voice ? ["-v", voice, text] : [text]`, passing the user's `text` as the first
  positional with NO `--` option terminator. A text of "-0" / "--version" was reparsed by `say` as a flag (live: `say
  "-0"` → exit 1 "invalid option"), so a user asking Muse to speak a dash-leading string silently failed. FIX:
  `["-v", voice, "--", text]` / `["--", text]` — `say` supports `--` (independently live-verified by the Fable-5 judge:
  `say -- "-0"` → exit 0; mdfind/pbcopy do NOT, so the guard stays say-specific). TDD: leading-dash "-0"/"--version" →
  argv carries `--` before the text, spoke:true; the existing argv assertion updated (incidental characterization, no
  masked regression). macos 95/95, check 0 (all pkgs), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (runner seam contract-faithful; voice not a
  vector — consumed as the `-v` value, no shell). KIND security (argv injection), fresh surface.
- ✓→Done **muse.notes.save TOCTOU clobber** (fire 29; data-integrity / TOCTOU) — save did stat-then-writeFile, so a
  concurrent create landing between the stat and `nodeWriteFile(..., "utf8")` (flag `w`) was silently CLOBBERED under
  overwrite:false. FIX: write create-exclusive under !overwrite (`{ encoding: "utf8", flag: "wx" }`) so a stale probe +
  concurrent create yields EEXIST → "already exists" error instead of a clobber; added an injectable `probeExists` option
  (defaults to the prior stat-based check, byte-identical) so the TOCTOU window is deterministically testable. TDD 2
  (injected absent-probe + real pre-existing file → "already exists" + content unchanged; overwrite:true still replaces)
  RED(reverting wx → file clobbered to "CLOBBER")→GREEN; mcp 1728, check 0 (all pkgs), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS
  (contract-faithful real-fs write, only the probe injected; EEXIST mapping scoped to !overwrite so EACCES still surfaces
  as "cannot write note"; atomic guarantee is in `wx`, not the probe). KIND TOCTOU, fresh surface.
- ◦ **mac_spotlight_search argv-injection (fire-28 rejected, recorded)** — `mac_spotlight_search` (macos-tools.ts:1439)
  has the SAME leading-dash argv-injection as mac_say (fixed fire 28), BUT `mdfind` rejects `--` (`mdfind -- q` →
  "Unknown option"), so there's no one-line terminator fix — needs query-rewriting/escaping logic (a real ◦, not
  trivial). KIND security (argv injection).
- ✓→Done **muse.fs read corrupted multi-byte UTF-8 at the truncation edge** (EXPANSION gap-scout, fire 30;
  encoding round-trip / byte-boundary) — `read` truncated with `buffer.subarray(0, maxBodyBytes).toString("utf8")`,
  cutting mid-character whenever the 64KB cap lands inside a multi-byte sequence. Korean is 3 bytes/char, so the cap
  lands mid-char ~2/3 of the time → the agent ingested a U+FFFD replacement char at the truncation tail of every large
  Korean note (the tool promises "Reads a UTF-8 text file"). FIX: new exported pure helper `utf8SafeSliceEnd(buffer,
  maxBytes)` backs the cut off to the previous UTF-8 char boundary (walks back over 10xxxxxx continuation bytes); read
  wires it in. TDD 6 helper unit (fits/Korean-mid/exact-boundary/4-byte-emoji/ASCII-unchanged/non-positive) + 1 e2e
  (fake-fs "가나다라" maxBodyBytes:8 → "가나", no U+FFFD) RED(reverting wiring → "가나�")→GREEN; mcp 1735, check 0
  (all pkgs), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (RED re-confirmed; helper fuzzed 2000+ cases vs an optimal-prefix oracle — never
  over-shoots the cap, never over-trims a fitting char, longest valid prefix; ASCII test stays green). KIND
  encoding-boundary, fresh surface — directly fixes garbled tails in 진안's Korean notes.
- ✓→Done **loopback-fetch readBodyWithCap U+FFFD at the truncation tail** (fire 31; encoding-boundary + the ~10-fire
  JUDGE FAILURE DRILL) — `readBodyWithCap` decoded the truncating chunk with a NON-streaming `decoder.decode(head)`,
  flushing a partial multi-byte sequence at the cap to U+FFFD (a Korean body got "가나�"). KEY: the correct fix is NOT
  `utf8SafeSliceEnd(head)` as this ◦ originally guessed — that helper treats `head` as a standalone buffer and misreads
  leading continuation bytes when an earlier full chunk left pending bytes in the STREAMING decoder. The right fix is
  `decoder.decode(head, { stream: true })` + never flushing on the truncated branch (the `if (!truncated)` guard already
  skips the flush), so the partial char straddling the cap is buffered and dropped. TDD 2 ("가나다라" cap 8 → "가나";
  "가나" cap 2 → "") RED("가나�")→GREEN; mcp 1737, check 0 (all pkgs), lint 0. JUDGE DRILL: an inert slice (comment-only
  code change + a declaration-only test asserting just truncated:true/length>0) was planted FIRST; the Fable-5 verifier
  correctly FAILED it (traced result.body="가나�", flagged the test as declaration-only, AND independently derived the
  stream-flag fix) → rolled back → real fix applied + PASS. Judge drill 3/3 (fire 10 json.query, fire 21 regex, fire 31
  fetch). Optional follow-up (verifier note): a multi-chunk-stream test would pin the cross-chunk decoder-state case
  (currently proven ad hoc, not by a committed test).
- ✓→Done **muse.url.encode_query encoded null/undefined ARRAY items as "null"/"undefined"** (EXPANSION gap-scout,
  fire 32; contract-output-drift / inconsistent null handling) — the array branch guard
  `if (item !== null && item !== undefined && !isScalar(item)) return error` let a null/undefined item FALL THROUGH to
  `search.append(key, String(item))`, so `{tags:["a",null,"b"]}` emitted a corrupt `tags=a&tags=null&tags=b`. The SCALAR
  branch one line below explicitly skips null/undefined (and a unit test pins that skip as the contract) — so the array
  branch was internally inconsistent. FIX: `if (item === null || item === undefined) continue;` before the object check,
  matching the scalar branch. TDD (`["a",null,undefined,"b"]` → `tags=a&tags=b`; nested-object-in-array still rejected;
  falsy-but-valid `[0,false,""]` → `v=0&v=false&v=` still encode — strict null/undefined skip only) RED(`tags=null...`)
  →GREEN; mcp 1738, check 0 (all pkgs), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (RED re-confirmed by stashing src; nested object AND array
  still rejected; 0/false/"" still encode; no test pinned the old corrupt output). KIND contract-drift, fresh surface.
- ✓→Done **performConsentedAction let caller headers override the consent-gated credential** (EXPANSION gap-scout,
  fire 33; SECURITY — credential-override / fail-open on the outbound-safety seam) — the fetch headers were
  `{ authorization: \`Bearer ${credential}\`, ...(body?{content-type}), ...request.headers }` with the caller's
  `request.headers` spread LAST, so `request.headers.authorization: "Bearer attacker"` silently REPLACED the
  consent-gated token, and the case-variant `{ Authorization: ... }` produced two own keys that `new Headers()` merges
  into the corrupt `"Bearer svc-token, Bearer attacker"`. Violates outbound-safety.md's "Security is code, not a prompt"
  — the scoped credential is supposed to be the only Bearer that leaves. FIX: strip every caller header whose
  `.toLowerCase() === "authorization"` (`callerHeaders`) before spreading, so the code-owned token is unstrippable;
  non-auth headers (content-type, x-custom) still forward. TDD (lowercase + capitalized override attempts →

  →GREEN; mcp 1739, check 0 (playbook-store flake re-run green), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (RED re-confirmed by stashing src;
  all case variants covered; whitespace/Unicode keys are invalid header names → fail-closed via try/catch, not a bypass;
  consent/veto gates untouched). KIND security, fresh surface.
- ✓→Done **performConsentedAction: request.url destination-binding (credential-exfil guard)** (fire 34; SECURITY —
  fire-33 verifier finding) — `request.url` was fully caller-controlled with nothing tying it to the consent, so the
  scoped Bearer token could be sent to ANY url (`https://attacker.example/...`). DESIGN (verified: performConsentedAction
  + recordConsent have NO production callers — unwired P5-b3 primitive; trust-correct source = the consent RECORD set at
  grant time, NOT the caller's url, and NOT a non-existent service→host registry): `ScopedConsent` gained an OPTIONAL
  `allowedHost`; `performConsentedAction` refuses (fail-closed, no HTTP) when a consent's `allowedHost` is set and
  `new URL(request.url).host` differs OR the url is unparseable; added `findConsent` (returns the record; `hasConsent`
  delegates). TDD (consent bound to api.test + url to evil.example → refused, 0 HTTP; unparseable url → refused) RED
  (neutralize the check → token reaches evil.example)→GREEN; mcp 1741, check 0 (all pkgs), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS —
  including the userinfo bypass `https://api.test@evil.example/` → `host` resolves to `evil.example` → correctly
  refused; `host` (incl. port) is stricter than `hostname` (fail-closed-safe). KIND security, fresh surface.
- ◦ **performConsentedAction: make allowedHost MANDATORY / fail-closed-on-absence (fire-34 follow-up)** — the
  destination-binding is currently enforce-WHEN-PRESENT (optional), so a consent without `allowedHost` still sends the
  token to any url. Once the (future) grant flows that call `recordConsent` all populate `allowedHost`, flip it: make
  the field required (or treat absence as refuse) so the binding is fail-closed by construction, not opt-in. Slice =
  require allowedHost in `isScopedConsent` + refuse on absence in performConsentedAction + update the duplicate test
  corpus (consent literals live in BOTH src/*.test.ts and test/*.test.ts — ~10 sites). Gated on grant-flow wiring
  existing first (no production caller today).
- ✓→Done **muse.history.recent returned an EMPTY feed for a fractional limit < 1** (EXPANSION gap-scout, fire 35;
  boundary-condition / silent-failure) — `clampLimit` (loopback-history.ts:34) checked `raw <= 0` BEFORE truncating, so
  `limit: 0.5` passed the guard then `Math.trunc(0.5) === 0` → `Math.min(cap, 0) === 0` → the activity feed sliced to
  empty, so "what did I do last night?" with a model-emitted fractional limit silently answered "nothing happened"
  (`{entries: [], total: 0}`). 0 and negatives already correctly took the fallback (20). FIX: truncate BEFORE the
  positivity check so a sub-1 fractional joins 0/negatives in taking the fallback (self-consistent with history's own
  contract — NOT the proactive sibling's clamp-to-1, which has a different undefined→store-default contract). Exported
  `clampLimit` for direct unit testing. TDD 5 unit (0.5/0.999→20, 0/-5→20, 2.9→2, 1.5→1, 50→50, 500→200 cap,
  string/NaN/Inf→20) + 1 e2e (recent({limit:0.5}).total === recent({}).total, not 0) RED(0.5→empty)→GREEN; mcp 1747,
  check 0 (all pkgs), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (RED reproduced "expected 0 to be 5"; exact 1.0→1 boundary verified; valid
  integer limits unchanged; export not in barrel — no collision). KIND boundary, fresh surface.
- ✓→Done **browser_read `find` pagination was a dead-end / loop trap** (EXPANSION gap-scout, fire 36;
  contract-output-drift) — the tool description promises "A long page reports total + hasMore/nextOffset; pass offset to
  read the next batch", and the no-find branch (snapshotToJson) honours it, but the FIND branch did
  `matched.slice(0, BROWSER_MAX_ELEMENTS)` (always from 0, ignoring the documented `offset` arg) and returned only
  `{ hasMore: true }` with NO `nextOffset`. So when >50 elements matched, the local 8B was told hasMore, followed the
  protocol (`find` + `offset`), and got the SAME first 50 back forever — a loop trap. FIX: align the find branch with
  snapshotToJson — clamp offset, slice `[start, start+MAX)`, emit `offset`/`hasMore`/`nextOffset`. TDD (60 matches:
  find→50 + nextOffset:50; find+offset:50→10, offset:50, ref continuity) RED(force start=0 → offset:50 returned the
  first 50 again)→GREEN; browser 58, check 0 (all pkgs), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (RED re-confirmed; past-end clamps to
  empty, negative clamps to 0, contiguous pages no dupes/skips, filterElements order-stable; only consumer is the CLI
  tool registration — opaque JSON to the model). KIND contract-drift, fresh surface (browser). Minor pre-existing nit
  (out of scope): the find branch names the count `matched` while no-find uses `total`.
- ✓→Done **dismissPattern lost-update race (user veto could be silently dropped)** (EXPANSION gap-scout, fire 37;
  lost-update / concurrent RMW missing serialisation) — `dismissPattern` did an UNSERIALISED read→append→write on
  patterns-fired.json while its sibling `recordPatternFired` already wraps the identical RMW in `withFileMutationQueue`.
  Concurrent in-process dismissals/fires read the same snapshot → last write clobbers the rest → a lost dismissal means
  Muse keeps suggesting a pattern the user explicitly vetoed (learned-avoidance dropped — the trust failure proactivity
  exists to avoid); same-ms writes also crashed on the `tmp-${pid}-${Date.now()}` rename (ENOENT). FIX: wrap the body in
  the per-file queue (mirrors recordPatternFired); deleted a stale JSDoc that falsely claimed "the daemon is the only
  writer… we accept that [clobber] trade". TDD (Promise.all of 12 dismiss + 13 fire on one file → all 25 present, all 12
  dismissals survive) RED(revert queue → ENOENT/lost record)→GREEN; mcp 1748, check 0 (messaging pending-approval flake
  unrelated, isolated 17/17), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (read inside critical section; no nested-queue deadlock; non-flaky).
- ◦ **patterns-fired (and sibling stores) lack CROSS-PROCESS write serialisation (fire-37 verifier finding)** —
  `withFileMutationQueue` serialises only WITHIN one process, but the motivating race is the CLI `muse pattern dismiss`
  vs the proactive daemon — TWO OS processes writing the SAME patterns-fired.json. Atomic rename prevents corruption but
  NOT a cross-process clobber (a dismissal landing between the daemon's read and write is still lost). This is
  pre-existing and shared by every store on the queue. FIX (if it ever bites): a file lock (lockfile / flock) around the
  RMW. Slice = a cross-process lock primitive + wire the patterns-fired RMWs + a two-process race test (spawn). Larger;
  gated on whether single-user concurrency is real enough to justify the complexity.
- ✓→Done **writeFollowupLlmBudget hand-rolled write (same-ms ENOENT crash + orphaned tmp)** (EXPANSION gap-scout,
  fire 38; resource-leak / race-induced crash) — `writeFollowupLlmBudget` hand-rolled `tmp-${pid}-${Date.now()}` then
  open/write/sync/rename with NO catch-cleanup, while the SAME package's `atomicWriteFile` already fixes exactly this
  class (randomUUID tmp + fsync + 0o600 + orphan cleanup) and the module already imports `withFileMutationQueue` from it.
  Two same-ms writers → identical tmp → the slower rename ENOENT-crashes; any write/rename failure orphans the tmp
  (UNCONDITIONALLY real, independent of concurrency). FIX: replace the body with `atomicWriteFile(file, payload)` (byte-
  identical payload, same fsync/0o600 durability). TDD (frozen Date.now → 2 concurrent writes both resolve + no `.tmp-`
  orphan) RED(ENOENT rename on `budget.json.tmp-<pid>-1700000000000`)→GREEN; mcp 1749, check 0 (all pkgs), lint 0.
  Fable-5 PASS (durability preserved; both defects closed; the one production caller composes inside its queue). The
  collision is defense-in-depth (writeFollowupLlmBudget is a public export) but the orphan defect was unconditionally
  real. KIND resource-leak, fresh surface.
- ◦ **appendReminderHistory hand-rolls the same tmp write (fire-38 runner-up)** — `personal-reminder-history-store.ts`
  (~line 64-68) hand-rolls `tmp-${pid}-${Date.now()}` with NO fsync and no leak cleanup. Same one-line `atomicWriteFile`
  adoption. Lower urgency: it sits inside the mutation queue so the in-process collision is unreachable and the fsync gap
  isn't behaviorally testable — but adopting the shared primitive removes the orphan-on-failure leak + the fsync gap.
  Slice: swap to atomicWriteFile + a no-orphan-on-injected-failure test (or accept it's covered by the primitive's tests).
- ◦ **cleanupFollowupTempFiles is dead-wired (fire-37/38 runner-up, NOT a crisp fix)** — `personal-followups-store.ts`
  `cleanupFollowupTempFiles` docstring claims "Called by readFollowups" but has ZERO production callers (only a test), so
  crash-orphaned followup tmp files accumulate forever. The naive wiring (call it from readFollowups) is NOT objectively
  correct — readFollowups runs unqueued from the list tool, so cleanup could unlink an in-flight atomicWriteFile tmp
  before its rename and kill a concurrent write; the safe fix needs an mtime age-gate whose threshold is a judgment call.
  Real leak but needs a design decision — record, don't auto-pick.
- ✓→Done **active objective with an unparseable nextEvalAt was silently frozen forever** (EXPANSION gap-scout, fire 39;
  silent-failure / NaN-poisoned date comparison) — the `due` filter was
  `o.status === "active" && (!o.nextEvalAt || Date.parse(o.nextEvalAt) <= nowMs)`; a non-ISO nextEvalAt makes
  `Date.parse` → NaN, `NaN <= nowMs` → false, and `!o.nextEvalAt` is false (truthy string), so the objective is EXCLUDED
  from `due` on EVERY tick forever — never evaluated, never escalated (contradicts the module's "never silently dropped"
  contract; the same file already guards this exact NaN-poison class for maxPerTick). Reachable via a hand-edited /
  foreign-written objectives.json (isStandingObjective never validates nextEvalAt). FIX: fail-open to evaluation when
  unparseable (`!Number.isFinite(nextMs) || nextMs <= nowMs`); the backoff path then rewrites a valid ISO (self-heal).
  TDD (nextEvalAt:"not-a-date" → evaluated once, retried, persisted nextEvalAt now parseable === nowMs+1000)
  RED(excluded → evaluated 0)→GREEN; mcp 1750, check 0 (all pkgs), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (future-valid still excluded so
  cooldown intact; no legitimate non-ISO sentinel — "never" is status not a magic string; self-heals after one eval).
  KIND silent-failure, fresh surface.
- ◦ **append-only stores silently DESTROY a forward-version entry on the next write (fire-39 runner-up)** —
  `appendActionLog` (personal-action-log-store.ts:212-221) and `addObjective`/`patchObjective`
  (personal-objectives-store.ts:97-130) round-trip through a validation-FILTERING read (`readActionLog`/`readObjectives`
  flatMap-drop entries failing `isActionLogEntry`/`isStandingObjective`), so any stored entry a newer schema wrote (e.g.
  a forward `result` value or unknown field) is permanently ERASED by the next unrelated append — violating the
  documented "APPEND-ONLY… preserved verbatim / never silently destroyed (quarantine)" contract. FIX needs a RAW-read
  path for the write (read+append+write on the raw array, validate only on the READ-for-consumers path) — bigger than
  one filter line. Slice: add a raw passthrough reader + wire the append/patch RMWs + a forward-compat test (seed an
  entry with an extra field, append another, assert the first survives byte-identical). Two stores share the KIND+shape.
  BLOCKERS (fire-40 eval, NOT a clean single fix — needs a design decision): (a) the action-log is a HASH-CHAIN
  (`prevHash: chainTipHash(existing)`), so preserving an unvalidatable forward-version entry breaks the typed
  chain-hash computation — raw preservation + chain integrity conflict; (b) "corrupt entry (drop is correct)" vs
  "forward-version entry (preserve)" are INDISTINGUISHABLE to `isActionLogEntry`, so preserve-unknown also re-persists
  genuine garbage — a real preserve-vs-drop judgment, not a mechanical fix. The objectives store (no hash chain) is the
  cleaner first target IF the preserve-unknown policy is decided. 진안 input on the policy + chain handling.
- ✓→Done **muse.calendar.update silently dropped an unparseable startsAt/endsAt and reported success** (EXPANSION
  gap-scout, fire 40; missing-validation) — `resolvedStartsAt = startsAtRaw ? parseIsoDate(...) : undefined` returns
  undefined for an unresolvable phrase, then the spread `...(newStartsAt ? {startsAt} : {})` omitted the move and
  `update` called `registry.updateEvent` + returned `{event}` SUCCESS — so "move my dentist to flurbsday" reported done
  while nothing moved. The sibling `add` already errors on this exact condition; a parseable start + unparseable end
  also moved the start but left the end (end-before-start risk). FIX: error (mirroring `add`) when a raw startsAt/endsAt
  was PROVIDED but parses to undefined, BEFORE updateEvent (omitted args unaffected; valid phrases still parse). TDD
  (startsAt:"flurbsday" → error + updateEvent NOT called; valid-start + endsAt:"flurbsday" → error + no call — the
  τ-bench no-partial-side-effect property) RED(remove guards → updateEvent called, success)→GREEN; mcp 1752, check 0
  (all pkgs), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (omitted untouched, newEndsAt fallback algebraically identical, no partial state).
  KIND missing-validation, fresh surface. (Side effect, per the slice's intent: an empty-string "" startsAt/endsAt now
  errors too, consistent with `add`.)
- ◦ **calendar.add silently coerces an unparseable endsAt to start+60min (fire-40 runner-up)** — `add`'s endsAt
  fallback (`(endsAtRaw && isTimeOnlyPhrase ? ... : parseIsoDate(endsAtRaw)) ?? new Date(startsAt+60min)`) means a
  PROVIDED-but-unparseable endsAt silently becomes a 1-hour default instead of erroring — the same family as the update
  fix. Lower urgency (endsAt is optional with a sensible default, vs update's success-while-noop), and erroring needs to
  preserve the omitted-endsAt→default path. Slice: error only when `endsAtRaw !== undefined && parse === undefined` +
  test. Also (fire-40 verifier nit): a non-string startsAt (numeric epoch) is silently ignored via readString→undefined
  on BOTH add and update — string-but-unparseable is fixed, wrong-TYPE is not; fold into the same slice if worth it.
- ✓→Done **appendReminderHistory persisted secrets to the plaintext audit log unscrubbed** (EXPANSION gap-scout,
  fire 41; SECRET-LEAK / data-integrity) — `appendReminderHistory` appended the raw `entry` to reminder-history.json
  while the SIBLING proactive-history store deliberately scrubs at the persist chokepoint
  (`redactSecretsInText(title/text/error)`). So a reminder "rotate key sk-proj-…" is DELIVERED scrubbed (the delivery
  path scrubs only the copy it SENDS) but ARCHIVED VERBATIM; `error` can also quote an upstream response body (e.g. a
  Telegram bot token). FIX: scrub `text` + `error` at the chokepoint (`{ ...entry, text: redactSecretsInText(text),
  ...(error ? { error: redactSecretsInText(error) } : {}) }`) — exact parity with the proactive sibling, so every caller
  inherits it. TDD (text with sk-proj key + error with telegram token → read-back has `[redacted-openai-key]` /
  `[redacted-telegram-bot-token]`, raw tokens absent) RED(raw entry → plaintext key persisted)→GREEN; mcp 1753, check 0
  (all pkgs), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (text+error = full secret-bearing set; destination non-secret by the messaging
  contract; chokepoint inherited by both call sites). KIND secret-leak, fresh surface — directly on Muse's "it can't
  tell anyone" identity.
- ◦ **reminder daemon prints raw error strings to daemon.out.log (fire-41 verifier finding; secret-leak)** —
  `runDueReminders` returns raw `errors` strings (reminder-firing-loop.ts:~140 — the same upstream error that can quote
  a Telegram/Slack token), and the daemon prints them to stdout, which the macOS LaunchAgent persists to
  `daemon.out.log` (commands-daemon.ts:~486). Reminder TEXT is not echoed there (only error strings), but a
  token-quoting send failure archives the raw token in that log. FIX: apply `redactSecretsInText` at the daemon's
  error-print seam (and/or scrub the `errors` array in the summary). Slice: 1 wrap + 1 test (a secret-bearing error →
  the printed/returned string is redacted). Fresh surface (daemon stdout).
- ✓→Done **commitment check-ins lost-update / stale-snapshot write** (EXPANSION gap-scout, fire 42; data-integrity /
  lost-update) — `appendCheckins` did an UNQUEUED read→append→write, and `runDueCheckins` read `all` (snapshot), awaited
  multi-second network sends, then wrote `all.map(...)` (the STALE pre-send snapshot) — so a check-in appended (chat-turn
  hook) or cancelled DURING the send window was clobbered: a fresh check-in vanished, a CANCELLED nudge RESURRECTED and
  re-fired (trust failure — the user silenced it). Siblings (followups/objectives) use `withFileMutationQueue`; this
  store predates the pattern. FIX: wrap `appendCheckins` in the per-file queue; make the fired-status write re-read the
  FRESH store inside the queue and patch ONLY the fired ids, not the stale `all`. TDD (registry.send appends a check-in
  mid-send → it survives + the fired one is marked; 2 concurrent appendCheckins both persist) RED(stale write clobbers +
  ENOENT)→GREEN; mcp 1773, check 0 (all pkgs), lint 0. Fable-5 PASS (re-read inside queue, patch-by-id, cancel-not-
  resurrected by construction, no deadlock — send loop OUTSIDE the queue; scope honest: fixes IN-PROCESS races,
  cross-process CLI-cancel-vs-daemon is the existing file-lock ◦). KIND lost-update, fresh surface.
- ◦ **commitment-checkin keeps a bespoke writeFileAtomic (pid+Date.now tmp) (fire-42 verifier nit)** — the store's local
  `writeFileAtomic` (line ~226) still uses `${file}.tmp-${pid}-${Date.now()}` instead of the shared `atomicWriteFile`
  (randomUUID + orphan cleanup). The queue masks the in-process collision on the fixed paths, but the CLI's direct
  `writeCheckins` (cancel/snooze, unqueued + cross-process) can still hit the same-ms ENOENT + orphan. FIX: adopt
  `atomicWriteFile`. Joins the appendReminderHistory tmp-write ◦ (same one-line swap, resource-leak KIND).
- ✓→Done **proactive-notice firedKey separator-injection collision (a real notice silently suppressed)** (EXPANSION
  gap-scout, fire 43; dedup / key-collision) — `firedKey` built the dedup key as `${kind} ${id} ${startIso}` (space-join
  of free-form fields). `id` is a provider event / task id (untrusted, can contain spaces), so two DISTINCT
  {kind,id,startIso} tuples collide on one key (id="a b"+startIso="X" vs id="a"+startIso="b X" both → "calendar a b X");
  the dedup `seen.has(key) → continue` then SILENTLY SUPPRESSES a legitimate second proactive notice — violating the
  module's own "fires at most once per {kind,id,startIso} tuple" contract. FIX: `JSON.stringify([kind,id,startIso])`
  (unambiguous; JSON escapes field boundaries — injective). In-memory key (rebuilt each run from the entries sidecar),
  so NO persisted migration. TDD: unit (collision pair → distinct keys; same tuple → same key) + e2e (crafted colliding
  sidecar entry → runDueProactiveNotices fires the new event, summary.fired===1) RED(space-join → suppressed,
  fired=0)→GREEN; mcp 1776, check 0 (all pkgs), lint 0. Opus PASS (JSON injective incl. quote/bracket injection;
  entries-not-keys persisted so backward-compatible; reachable — calendar event ids are provider-reported/untrusted).
  KIND dedup, fresh surface. (Fable-5 was unavailable this fire; scout + judge ran on Opus 4.8 per the fallback.)
- ✓→Done **objective verdict parser leaked a NESTED outcome → FALSE autonomous `met`** (EXPANSION gap-scout, fire 44;
  parsing-bug / safety — false-positive completion) — `balancedJsonCandidates` (objective-evaluator.ts:79-110) pushed
  every balanced `{...}` span starting at every `{` WITHOUT advancing past a consumed span, so a NESTED object was
  re-extracted as its own candidate. `parseObjectiveVerdict` takes the LAST candidate with a recognized `outcome`, so
  `{"plan":{"outcome":"met"},"note":"not yet"}` leaked the inner `{"outcome":"met"}` → returned `met` — the one outcome
  the module promises "never a false met" (it's autonomous: `runDueObjectives` calls `act()` + flips status:done on a
  `met` verdict). FIX: after pushing a balanced span ending at `j`, set `i = j` so only TOP-LEVEL objects are verdict
  candidates; a nested-only outcome is ambiguous ⇒ the conservative `unmet`. TDD (nested-only met → unmet; nested-in-
  array → unmet; top-level unmet + nested met → unmet) RED(remove i=j → false met)→GREEN; mcp 1778, check 0 (all pkgs),
  lint 0. Opus PASS (separate top-level objects still both extracted; brace-in-string/escaped-quote unaffected; the
  evaluator SYSTEM_PROMPT demands a TOP-LEVEL `{outcome,reason}` so a nested-only reply is off-spec → unmet is correct,
  not a dropped legit verdict). KIND parsing-bug, fresh surface — directly on the fabrication=0 / autonomous-safety edge.
- ✓→Done **runDueFollowups fired an arbitrary file-order slice, starving the most-overdue followup** (EXPANSION
  gap-scout, fire 45; sort-ordering + the ~10-fire JUDGE FAILURE DRILL) — the due selection was
  `all.filter(scheduled && scheduledFor<=now).slice(0, max)` with NO sort, so when a backlog exceeds `maxPerTick` (a
  daemon catching up after downtime), the FILE-FIRST commitments fire and the genuinely most-overdue self-followup is
  deferred tick after tick. The sibling `compareFollowupsByScheduledFor` (soonest-first) existed but was never applied.
  FIX: `.sort(compareFollowupsByScheduledFor)` before `.slice(0, max)` (soonest-scheduledFor = most-overdue for past
  times). TDD (3 distinct-due followups, oldest written LAST, maxPerTick:1 → fired[0].id==="fu_oldest" + the other two
  stay scheduled) RED(no sort → fires file-first "fu_recent")→GREEN; mcp 1779, check 0 (all pkgs), lint 0. JUDGE DRILL:
  an inert slice (comment-only code + a test asserting just `delivered===1`) was planted FIRST; the Opus verifier
  correctly FAILED it (empirically probed fired[0].id==="fu_recent", flagged the test as count-only, derived the sort
  fix) → rolled back → real fix + PASS. Judge drill 4/4 (fire 10 json.query, 21 regex, 31 fetch, 45 followups). KIND
  sort-ordering, fresh surface. (Fable-5 unavailable; scout + both judge passes ran on Opus 4.8 per the fallback.)
- ✓→Done **runDueObjectives left backoffBaseMs/backoffMaxMs un-NaN-guarded → objective spins every tick** (EXPANSION
  gap-scout, fire 46; missing-validation / NaN-poison) — `maxPerTick`/`maxAttempts` are `Number.isFinite`-guarded (the
  file's own comment names this class) but `const base = options.backoffBaseMs ?? DEFAULT; const cap = options.backoffMaxMs
  ?? DEFAULT` used bare `??`, which does NOT catch NaN/Infinity. A non-finite backoff → `delay = Math.min(cap, NaN*…) =
  NaN` → `new Date(nowMs + NaN).toISOString()` throws RangeError → the sibling-protecting catch swallows it → the
  objective never gets a new nextEvalAt and re-evaluates EVERY tick forever (backoff defeated, the exact failure the
  comment claims to prevent). FIX: mirror the guard — `Number.isFinite(base) ? base : DEFAULT` for BOTH base and cap. TDD
  (backoffBaseMs:NaN → retried + valid nextEvalAt = nowMs+60_000, not errored; backoffMaxMs:NaN → also guarded) RED(bare
  ?? → RangeError, retried empty)→GREEN; mcp 1780, check 0 (all pkgs), lint 0. Opus PASS (NaN/Inf/undefined caught,
  finite incl 0 preserved, base+cap symmetric; verifier nit "cap not independently tested" addressed with a cap-NaN
  case). KIND missing-validation; same file + NaN-poison class as fire 39 (nextEvalAt) — completes the file's guard
  symmetry. (Fable-5 unavailable; scout + judge on Opus 4.8.)
- ◦ **tool-arg grounding coverage** — extend `groundedArgs` (the deterministic anti-fabrication
  boundary) to every actuator persisting model-named free-text; one behavioral drop test each.
  DONE: `tasks.add` (notes/tags), `tasks.update` (notes), `add_contact` (relationship), `calendar`
  (location/notes), `followup.cancel` (reason) — each Opus-verifier-traced to the runtime grounding.
  REMAINING: spot-audit other update/edit paths' optional free-text (reminders has none fabricable —
  text=user-stated, dueAt=time, recurrence=enum).
- ✓→Done **content-sniff over extension** — file_read now classifies by CONTENT
  (`sniffFileKind`/`resolveFileKind`): `%PDF` magic always wins (a mislabeled `.txt`-that-is-a-PDF
  routes to the extractor), an extensionless download with text bytes reads (extension-only refused
  it), a NUL/binary blob is still refused. Extension stays the fast path; the sniff is the
  correction. Also fixed classifyFileKind's no-dot bug (`split('.').pop()` returned the whole name).
  TDD 10 cases (sniff + resolve + 2 tool integration); eval:file-read gains the no-ext + mislabeled
  real-file round-trips; mcp 1616, check 0, lint 0.
- ✓→Done **web_action URL vetting (SSRF guard)** — the existing assertPublicHttpUrl guard protected
  muse.web.read (READ) but NOT web_action (state-changing SUBMIT — the higher-risk tool was the
  unguarded path). Wired it in BEFORE the approval gate/any HTTP. Split the guard into a sync half
  (assertPublicHttpUrlSync: protocol + literal loopback/private/link-local IP + blocked host — always
  on, no DNS) and the async DNS-rebinding layer (opt-in via deps.lookup), so literal SSRF
  (127.0.0.1, 169.254.169.254 metadata, file://) is always blocked and the happy path needs no
  resolver. TDD 4 SSRF cases + injected-private-resolver (DNS-rebinding); web_action selection
  unaffected (eval:tools actuator scenario), mcp 1620, check 0, lint 0, precheck:grounding pass^2.

## Open — 2026-06-10 full-feature audit (3 reviewers; VERIFIED findings → fix queue)

FIXED already: actuator non-TTY fail-close (d7112db9) · hybrid-MMR scale bug · write-run cache
replay (this commit). Remaining, severity order:

- ✓→Done **Ink chat output gate** — finalizeGatedChatAnswer (the ONE shared post-stream pipeline:
  gate→reverify→citation strips→receipt) now runs on the Ink surface AND chat-repl was refactored
  onto it so the surfaces cannot drift again; groundingFor returns matches; render test pins that
  a fabricated answer is gated before display AND before history commit. (CLI audit #1, HIGH)
- ✓→Done **calendar↔reminder lifecycle link on EVERY surface** — helpers moved to
  @muse/mcp (event-reminder-link.ts), wired into the MCP update/delete executors (results carry
  remindersShifted/remindersRemoved) AND the API DELETE route; CLI re-exports. BONUS: a fired
  reminder rescheduled into the future resets to pending (audit CLI #3) while a still-past shift
  never instant-re-fires. 5/5 incl. loopback integration + no-partial-side-effect. (both audits, HIGH)
- ✓→Done (reminders) **Reminders store unserialized RMW → serialized via mutateReminders** — the
  daemon firing loop read the reminders once then wrote its in-memory copy per delivery, CLOBBERING a
  reminder a chat `add` wrote after the tick started (the reported daemon-vs-chat lost write). Added
  `mutateReminders(file, fn)` = read→fn→write under the cross-process `withFileLock`; converted EVERY
  RMW site (add, snooze, fire, delete in loopback-reminders + the firing loop's per-delivery write,
  which now re-reads current and marks fired by id, merging with concurrent adds). TDD 3 (two
  concurrent adds both persist, mutate returns+persists, serial sequence keeps all); mcp 1651, check
  0, lint 0. FOLLOW-UP: the TASKS store has the same shape — apply mutateTasks next.
- ✓→Done (tasks) **Tasks store unserialized RMW → serialized via mutateTasks** — same fix as

- ✓→Done **Calendar store + credential store: corrupt file → silent full wipe** — both
  `LocalCalendarProvider.readAll` and `FileCalendarCredentialStore.readAll` returned empty on
  JSON-parse-failure OR schema-mismatch, and the next atomic write then overwrote the corrupt-but-
  recoverable original — permanent data loss. Adopted the sibling reminders-store posture via a shared
  `corrupt-quarantine.ts` (`quarantineCorruptStore` = best-effort rename to `<file>.corrupt-<ts>`),
  called on all 4 corrupt branches; writes were already atomic (tmp→rename). TDD 3 (corrupt JSON +
  schema-mismatch quarantined with original bytes preserved; credential corrupt quarantined) RED 3/3 →
  GREEN; calendar 152, check 0, lint 0. Fable-5 verifier PASS (ENOENT/transient-IO not quarantined,
  predicate unchanged so strictly safer, rename preserves 0600, concurrency-safe). RESIDUAL (out of
  slice): local-provider's per-entry `isPersistedEvent` flatMap still silently drops INDIVIDUAL corrupt
  events from an otherwise-valid array — a partial-loss path (logs nothing); separate slice.
- ✓→Done **toolGrounded blanket bypass** — fixed; keys on non-empty toolGroundingSources, value checks
  always-on, single-source helper shared run()+stream. See the Done entry up top. (CLI audit #4)
- ✓→Done **Chat-only users never get the embedder migration** (CLI audit #5) —
  `refreshStaleNotesIndexForChat` gated re-embed on CONTENT staleness only and returned early when
  notes were unchanged, so a chat-only user (the desktop companion never runs `muse ask`, the only
  other reindex trigger) kept ranking v2-moe query vectors against a legacy v1 index forever
  (cross-model cosine noise above the 0.5 floor). FIX: read the index model BEFORE the staleness
  gate; re-embed on `modelStale || contentStale`, where `notesIndexNeedsModelMigration` =
  `resolveIndexModel(existing, requested) !== existing` (legacy→default migrates; custom/default/none
  unflagged so no every-turn loop). Made the fn exported + deps-injectable (isStale/reindex/
  readIndexModel) for an Ollama-free OUTCOME test. TDD 5 (1 helper unit + 4 DI behavioral: legacy-fresh
  reindexes to default, default/custom-fresh don't, content-stale still does) RED→GREEN; cli 2525,
  check 0, lint 0. Fable-5 verifier PASS. RESIDUAL (separate slice): if the embedder is DOWN during a
  model-mismatch rebuild, `reindexNotes` drops prior-entry carry-forward → saves an empty index until
  notes change / manual reindex (fail-close: zero hits → refusal, not fabrication; pre-existing path).

- ✓→measured **F2 BM25 promotion: NO DELTA** — bm25Scores + RRF already existed

  exact-string identifier probe (ERR codes, license key, IP, model tag) both saturate 100%
  with bm25 on OR off — the default lexical-overlap arm already handles identifier tokens.
  Default stays off (no unverified win); revisit only if real-trace misses provide
  discriminating cases. Contextual chunk annotation (Anthropic slice 2) remains a candidate.
- ✓→Done **F3 KnowNo conformal tool selection (offline)** — `pnpm eval:conformal-tools`:
  MCQA top_logprobs + leave-one-out conformal at α=0.1 over the 14-case time family →
  coverage 13/14 (92.9% ≥ 90% target), wrong-but-confident 0, unnecessary clarifies 0

  = `ln(Σ tⱼ⁻ᵈ)` + 9-case battery SHIPPED in `@muse/memory` (recall-promotion.ts). fire 2: the DATA
  FOUNDATION — `personal-recall-hits-store.ts` now logs a bounded `recentAccessMs` per memory (cap 20,
  tolerant migration of old records, garbage-sanitizing read). fire 3: WIRED — `recallActivation` +
  opt-in `useActrRanking` on selectPromotable/selectForgettable ranks by ACT-R (frequency×spacing)
  while the eligibility GATE stays on the plain recency score (scale-safe); enabled at the `muse memory
  consolidate`/promote call sites. ⏳ REMAINING (review-gate decision): a measured A/B on whether ACT-R

  token-coverage subsumption + non-transitive anti-collapse GUARD) was already implemented & wired
  ahead of the LLM merge; the MISSING piece — a DIRECT anti-collapse invariant battery — was added
  (7 cases incl. the non-vacuous property "if it returns a survivor, that survivor token-covers EVERY
  input", so a learned strategy is never silently dropped). Test-only; agent-core 1691 green.]
- ✓→Done **Multi-group/multivalid conformal UQ for abstention** — pooled abstention calibration
  over an EN-only corpus silently loses its coverage guarantee on the Korean subgroup (the exact
  failure of arXiv:2407.21057, Liu & Wu). [DONE 2026-06-13, cognition loop fire 29:

  groups) in conformal.ts + additive `groups`/`calibration`/`groupCoverageViolations` in
  `scoreGroundingEval` + per-group rows & ⚠ violation render in grounding-eval-runner; made LIVE by
  adding a Korean subgroup (12 answerable + 4 must-refuse + 12 grounded notes) to the production
  `GROUNDING_EVAL_CORPUS` — `muse doctor --grounding` now renders latin+hangul groups (judge v1 FAIL
  caught it inert on the EN-only corpus; v2 PASS proved live on real Ollama). Additive measurement
  only, verdict/threshold unchanged (fabrication-floor safe).]
- ◦ **Per-group abstention threshold at serve time** — `calibrateAbstentionByGroup` now MEASURES the
  per-script-family gap; the follow-up is to SERVE the per-group tau (route a Korean query through the
  hangul threshold, not pooled) once the per-group calibration set is large enough to trust. (next)

  it and down-ranks faded sessions ×FADE_PENALTY=0.5 (post-minScore-gate, ranking-only, never deletes);
  re-recalled memories auto-reinstate via consolidate overwrite + lastHitMs reset. Judge PASS: session-key
  identity holds end-to-end, counterfactual robust, fail-open 3 layers, fabrication floor intact.]
- ◦ **MemoryBank daemon auto-refresh** — consolidate is manual/on-demand, so the fade sidecar only
  refreshes when a human runs it. Wire `writeFadedMemoryKeys` into `memory-consolidate-tick.ts` +
  `commands-daemon.ts` behind the existing `MUSE_SELFLEARN_ENABLED` gate so fade refreshes automatically
  on the background tick. (fire-30 remainder; also: FadeMem-style importance term in `selectForgettable`.)
- ✓→Done **ReConcile consensus-gated council rounds** — `muse swarm council` ran a fixed round count
  blind to convergence (MAST step-repetition + termination-unawareness, arXiv:2309.13007 Chen/Saha/Bansal
  ACL 2024). [DONE 2026-06-13, cognition loop fire 31: `hasCouncilConsensus` (every member's mean pairwise
  Jaccard support ≥ DEFAULT_COUNCIL_AGREE_AT=0.16) added to the debate loop condition; `--rounds` default
  bumped 1→2 (required — the loop is dormant at 1) so an agreed panel stops at round 1 and only a contested
  panel spends the (previously dormant) debate round, bounded by the unchanged cap 3. Single gather-closure
  seam → the assembled-path test drives the real production loop. Judge PASS: both counterfactuals
  non-vacuous, refactor behavior-preserving, floor-safe (gate only shortens; dedupe/screen/id-gate/reverify
  unchanged).]
- ◦ **Council cross-lingual consensus (KO/EN agreeing panel)** — `hasCouncilConsensus` uses Jaccard token
  overlap, so a genuinely-agreeing KO+EN panel scores support ~0 → falsely "diverged" → wastes one bounded
  round (no floor violation; cap holds). Same CJK hazard family as fire-28's outlier screen. Needs an
  embedding-based cross-lingual similarity to fix both. (judge-flagged fire 31)
- ◦ **Stabilize mcp playbook-store weighted-eviction test flake** — `playbook-store.test.ts:309`
  (recordPlaybookStrategy weighted eviction, added fire 27) times out at the 5000ms per-test default under
  full-suite parallel load; passes 1696/1696 in isolation. Raise the per-test timeout or reduce its async
  file-write count. (judge-flagged fire 31; same family as the cli chat-grounding concurrency flake)
- ✓→Done **BKT weakness resolution — close the Whetstone loop** — the weakness ledger was append-only
  (nothing recorded a gap got FIXED), so `muse recap` nagged about already-remediated grounding gaps for
  30 days (arXiv:2105.00385 Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, pyBKT EDM'21). [DONE 2026-06-13, cognition loop
  fire 32: `WeaknessEntry.pKnown` BKT mastery estimate raised by the grounding gate's own SUCCESS verdicts
  (`muse ask` grounded non-action → `recordWeaknessResolved`); `selectRemediableWeaknesses` drops mastered
  (pKnown≥0.95) entries. One grounded answer does NOT clear a weakness (needs 3 — slip/guess noise, pass^k
  spirit). Judge PASS: writer default-ON, reader = the selector recap reads, BKT math recomputed exact,
  both counterfactuals non-vacuous, answer path byte-identical, legacy entries unaffected.]
- ◦ **Doctor weakness nudge uses a different selector** — `muse doctor`'s fuel/--weaknesses nudge calls
  `selectDevFixableWeaknesses` (DEV_FIXABLE_AXES excludes grounding-gap), so BKT mastery (fire 32) doesn't
  affect it, and doctor's raw `formatWeaknesses` inventory still lists mastered topics (honest dump, not a
  nag). If desired, apply `!isMasteredWeakness` to the doctor inventory view too. (judge-flagged fire 32)
- ◦ **Whetstone resolution — remaining axes & decay** — fire 32 closed grounding-gap resolution only.
  Remainder: dev-axis resolution (clear `unbacked-action`/`wrong-tool` when the tool later succeeds);
  chat-path resolution (needs chat's wrong-value check as the success signal — chat has no grounded label);
  BKT+Forget P(F)>0 mastery decay for long-idle topics (pairs with fire 30's fade); surface the stored
  `hint` in the recap nudge line. (fire 32 remainder, arXiv:2105.00385)
- ✓→Done **MemRL two-phase value-aware playbook retrieval** — `scoreStrategy` blended RAW unbounded
  token-overlap relevance with a bounded ±2.5 reward, so fire-27's Memp tallies vanished on verbose
  queries and leaked past relevance on sparse ones (arXiv:2601.03192 MemRL, Zhang et al. 2026). [DONE
  2026-06-13, cognition loop fire 33: two-phase `rankEligible` — Phase A relevance gates eligibility
  (relevanceOnly>minScore, k1=2·topK), Phase B z-score-normalized `0.5·rel̂+0.5·Q̂−reflected` re-ranks
  among candidates so utility can never lift an off-topic strategy into the prompt. scoreStrategy removed;
  both lexical + embed rankers rewired. Judge PASS via real revert: raw blend fails the verbose-include,
  sparse-exclude, and applyPlaybook-render tests. Selection-only, floor untouched.]
- ◦ **Playbook recency-floor score-scale mix** — recency-floor top-ups (below-minScore banks) carry
  raw-composite scores into the final sort alongside Phase-B z-scores, so a top-up can render ABOVE a
  higher-value Phase-B pick in the [Learned Strategies] block ORDER (membership is correct; ordering only).
  Normalize top-ups onto the composite scale or append them after Phase-B picks. (judge-flagged fire 33)
- ◦ **MemRL remainder** — (a) Q-update EMA `Q ← Q + α(r−Q)` as an alternative to net tallies in
  adjustPlaybookReward; (b) close the bandit loop with automatic per-turn reinforcement from turn outcome
  (today reward writes are manual CLI + correction-decay only — the real cold-start fix); (c) λ sensitivity
  A/B (eval:playbook-rank) before tuning off the paper's 0.5; (d) tuned δ for the cosine channel.

- ✓→Done **Compaction-fidelity: salient detail retention** — conversation compaction dropped
  numbers/dates/decisions, duplicated the summary each round, and wiped a designed-but-dead StructuredFact
  field (arXiv:2511.17208 Zhou & Han, non-compressive detail retention). [DONE 2026-06-13, cognition loop
  fire 34: `salient-facts.ts` extracts VERBATIM NUMERIC/DECISION/ENTITY facts from user/assistant turns only
  (tool excluded), merges newest-wins into one `[Key details]` block in the compaction summary, and persists
  them instead of wiping. PROVABLY non-truncating: numeric = maximal-token-or-drop via a complete
  continuation-char set (digits∪separators∪scale-words∪Sino-Korean numerals, 4-way boundary guard); decision
  = fit-or-drop (no mid-sentence cut that would invert a Korean sentence-final negation). 5 adversarial judge
  FAIL rounds hardened the floor before PASS. Floor-strengthening (the chat number-value gate regains the
  true value post-compaction), additive, answer path byte-identical.]
- ◦ **Faithful KO numeric parser for salient facts** — fire 34's regex extractor DROPS (safely) what it
  can't parse faithfully: Latin-unit numbers (`42 people`), and KO multi-segment compounds (`3억 5천만원` =
  350,000,000, space-separated). A real Korean numeral parser (arabic + hangul numerals 영일이…, compound
  scales 천/만/억/조, spacing) would extract these whole. Until then they're omitted, not truncated.
  (fire 34 remainder, arXiv:2511.17208)
- ◦ **Compaction legacy-line dedup** — fire 34 deduped only the `[Key details]` block; the legacy
  "Tools kept / Recent user topics / [Pinned entities]" lines still accumulate one copy per compaction round
  in `buildCompactionSummaryText`. Strip-and-re-emit them the same way. (fire 34 remainder)
- ✓→Done **RAG-Fusion compound-query retrieval** — headline `muse ask` embedded the question once, so a
  compound question blended between topics and dropped one answer chunk at topK=3 (half-answer/false-refusal
  on a fully-covered corpus). [DONE 2026-06-13, cognition loop fire 35: `splitCompoundQuery` deterministically
  splits KO/EN coordinated questions into 2–3 clauses (each ≥2 content tokens, else []); `diversifyAskChunks`
  fuses each clause's cosine ranking into the existing RRF (arXiv:2402.03367 RAG-Fusion). Pure selection over
  the user's own chunks — per-chunk score stays full-query cosine so confidence is never inflated; fail-open;
  byte-identical when not compound. Judge PASS via real revert (non-vacuity test fails when fusion ignored).]
- ◦ **Fusion must-refuse verdict assertion** — `commands-ask-fusion.test.ts`'s must-refuse-compound case
  asserts only per-chunk score equality, not the `classifyRetrievalConfidence` verdict (the judge verified the
  verdict invariant manually; it's deterministic given unchanged scores). Add the explicit `verdict` assertion
  for defense-in-depth. (judge-flagged fire 35, low priority)
- ◦ **RAG-Fusion remainder** — (a) LLM-backed decomposition (full RQ-RAG, arXiv:2404.00610) for implicit
  compounds the deterministic splitter misses, gated like chat's `needsContextualRewrite`; (b) port the
  knowledge-recall second-hop PRF to the headline ask path for sequential bridge-entity questions; (c) extend
  the multi-hop A/B battery with compound-question joint@K cases to measure the live delta. (fire 35 remainder)

  self-replication channel before the round-2 debate digest / synthesis — arXiv:2410.07283 Lee & Tiwari
  2024). The BLOCKER is detector CALIBRATION: reusing `@muse/policy`'s `sharedInjectionPatterns` (tuned for
  hostile USER input) to screen fluent MODEL reasoning over-quarantines honest/dissenting peers — across 4
  adversarial judge rounds, FPs surfaced in `environment_extraction` (`env` in "envision"), `credential_extraction`
  (`token`+"give"), `prompt_override` (bare "from now on"), `sandbox_escape` ("without an approval check"),
  `cross_user_access` ("another" matches unanchored `other`), `training_data_extraction` ("print internal
  context"), and `role_override`'s debug-mode subpattern ("enable debug mode for this test"). Over-quarantine =
  silently dropping an honest peer = unacceptable (corrupts deliberation, subtle censorship). Whack-a-mole on
  subpatterns did not converge (each round found a new FP). PATH FORWARD (dedicated slice): build a council-LOCAL,
  prose-safe pattern set anchored to literal-attack token SEQUENCES (not single common words), empirically
  calibrated against a LARGE corpus of (legitimate model reasoning, genuine injection) pairs; the survived-all-4-rounds

  a correct paraphrase "임대료 125만원" dropped while a literal-echo peer with the WRONG number "월세 130만원"
  kept, because it mimicked surface tokens). Korean agglutinative tokenization makes synonyms share 0 tokens by
  construction. Dropping an honest/dissenting voice is a real harm even though downstream gates protect
  fabrication=0. The cross-SCRIPT case is already guarded (dominantScriptFamily) but same-script paraphrase is not.
- ✓→PARTIAL **ROOT-CAUSE semantic-similarity primitive for the council path** — [DONE peer↔peer half,
  2026-06-13 cognition loop fire 40: `councilMemberSupportsSemantic` (mean pairwise embedding cosine) replaces
  Jaccard token-overlap in `screenCouncilOutliers` when an embedder is injected (arXiv:2507.14649 Cleanse);
  embedder wired into the live `muse swarm council` synthesis path; COSINE_ABS_FLOOR=0.4; fail-open to Jaccard.
  This UNBLOCKS the two deferred council screens — the embed seam + cosine-support primitive now exist on the path.]
  REMAINING follow-ons (now thin, reuse the primitive):
  - ✓→Done **fire-39 question-relevance gate, semantic version** — [DONE 2026-06-13 cognition loop fire 41:
    `screenOffTopicUtterancesSemantic` (cosine question↔reasoning < QUESTION_RELEVANCE_FLOOR=0.3) in
    synthesizeCouncilAnswer; semantic cosine keeps KO-paraphrase + cross-lingual on-topic peers (fixes the
    fire-39 lexical false-drop), drops genuine off-topic; deny-only, fail-open, no lexical fallback. Judge PASS
    via real revert. Backlog: tune floor on live KO/EN battery; strengthen the CLI assembled-path test (vacuous
    on revert — masked by downstream consensus-outlier; the agent-core reason==='off-topic' test is the clean proof).]
  - ◦ **fire-36 injection-quarantine, re-scoped** — semantic-divergence signal or a council-local prose-safe detector
    instead of the chat-guard lexical patterns.
  - ◦ **semantic hasCouncilConsensus (fire 31)** — fire 40 left consensus on Jaccard; give it cosine support too (cosine-calibrated agreeAt).
  - ◦ **discriminating cross-lingual fix test** — fire 40's KO+EN fix-tests are partly vacuous (Jaccard all-zero → relFloor×0 keeps all under both paths); add a majority-KO + minority-EN fixture (dropped under Jaccard, kept under semantic) to prove the fix end-to-end. (judge-flagged fire 40)
  - ◦ **tune COSINE_ABS_FLOOR on a live KO/EN council battery** — 0.4 is a best-guess default (smoke:live stalls; unvalidated on real nomic distributions). (fire 40)
- ◦ **Reflection-schedule guard** — one test enumerating retry/reflection call-sites, asserting
  each is verifier-backed (85.36% same-mistake repetition without one, arXiv 2510.18254). (T1-10)
- (queued behind fuel/prereqs: sleep-time compute · Mem0 UPDATE op · AWM workflow mining ·

## Open — agent-performance levers (ranked research pass 2026-06-10)

Full ranked list + sources: [`docs/strategy/agent-performance-levers.md`](../strategy/agent-performance-levers.md).
Levers #1 (multilingual embedder, SHIPPED — KO hit@1 50%→100%), #3 (KV posture + prefix
ordering, SHIPPED) and #2's mechanism+measurement are in Done below. Next from the list:

- ◦ **Tool-exemplar production wiring — gated on real-trace failures** — the mechanism
  (`selectToolExemplars`/`renderToolExemplarSection`) + the eval:tools A/B arm shipped; the
  golden set is near-saturated, so the lift must be demonstrated on REAL failing prompts.
  When labeled traces accumulate misses, extract an exemplar bank from successful traces and
  wire injection into the runtime tool path; promote on a measured eval:tools + replay win.
- ◦ **Local reranker on recall top-8** (lever #4) — Ollama has no rerank API; yes/no-logit
  workaround, flag-gated, A/B on the embedder-ab corpus + grounding battery.
- ◦ **`format` constraint on the non-reverify judge paths** — reverify judge DONE (see Done);
  remaining: llmJudge (eval-harness), correction-polarity, preference-inference.
- ◦ **source-trust live battery** — the marker + trusted bit shipped (see Done); remaining: a
  live `--with-tools` battery asserting the external-provenance heading appears on a
  web-grounded answer and NOT on a notes-grounded one.
- ✗ rejected this refill: "expose `muse notes graph/links`" (ALREADY exist — the -rag split
  trap again); "desktop lazy index load" (FALSIFIED — no startup parse); "REPL query-embedding
  cache" (near-zero hit rate; the real latency lever was prefix reuse, now shipped).

## Open — grounding edge (the maintained floor → frontier)

- ◦ **(follow-up) SQuAD drift arm — STABILIZE before optimizing** — a fire (2026-06-09)
  TRIED the obvious sharpen (pick drift answers with NO lexical overlap so coverage fully
  fails) and it made Δ WORSE: +0.63 → +0.13 (gate-ON catch 5/8 → 1/8). Reverted. The real
  finding: the SQuAD drift catch is HIGH-VARIANCE — the gate-ON path runs verifyGroundingWithReverify
  (a stochastic gemma reverify), so a single-run Δ on 8 cases is not stable, and the lexical-coverage
  hypothesis does not dominate the catch. So the right next step is STABILITY first: run the SQuAD
  arm at MUSE_EVAL_REPEAT≥3 (pass^k) and/or grow to 20-30 cases to get a stable number, THEN optimize.
  (Rejected: the disjoint-drift sharpen, as an unverified — in fact negative — win.)
- ⏳→✓ **Source-trust segregation — DECIDED 2026-06-10 (option B, per the standing
  decide-and-do directive) and the core shipped** (see Done): tool-derived citations live on the
  VerifiedSource/response-filters path, so the provenance marker went THERE (the sources block
  heading now names itself external/tool-fetched), plus `trusted:false` on the ask path's tool
  evidence so `groundedOnUntrustedOnly` has real input. Remaining: the live battery (Open above).
  Original framing kept below for context:
  `KnowledgeMatch.trusted` provenance bit + the pure detector `groundedOnUntrustedOnly` (flags a
  grounded answer resting ONLY on untrusted sources), agent-core, 4 tests. REMAINING — RE-SCOPED
  2026-06-09 (a fire found the naive wiring target wrong): tool-output does NOT become a
  `KnowledgeMatch` — it produces `VerifiedSource` (tool-output-evidence.ts) consumed by the
  response-filters path, SEPARATE from the grounding evidence set (`KnowledgeMatch` today comes only
  from the user's own notes, i.e. always trusted). So `groundedOnUntrustedOnly` has no untrusted input
  in the CURRENT graph — it is a forward-looking guard. Correct sub-slices: (1) DECIDE the design —
  merge tool-output INTO the grounding set with `trusted:false` (architectural), OR mark trust on the
  VerifiedSource/response-filters path where tool-derived citations actually live; (2) surface a marker
  when a cited claim rests only on untrusted provenance; (3) a live battery. Start with (1)'s decision.
  Below is the original framing (kept for context):
  NAMED (see Done: grounded-not-true.test.ts locks that a false-but-source-supported answer
  is "grounded", while a fabricated citation is still caught). The user's OWN false note is
  unfixable by design ("it's yours"), but an UNTRUSTED source (hostile/allowlisted MCP
  tool-output, per architecture.md) being treated as ground-truth IS fixable. Slice: tag
  evidence provenance (user-note vs tool-output) through the recall→gate path and surface a
  distinct verdict/marker when a grounded answer rests ONLY on untrusted tool-output, so the
  user knows the citation is not their own data. Source-veracity is impossible on a fixed 12B;
  source-TRUST segregation is not. (tool-output-evidence.ts already treats tool output as
  untrusted — thread that signal into verifyGrounding's evidence set.)
- ◦ **(follow-up) measure --best-of's answered-rate lift on a drift-prone corpus** —
  the mechanism shipped (see Done 2026-06-10) but its LIVE adoption path never fired in 3
  adversarial attempts (gemma4 + the gate are robust enough that a natural first-draft
  verdict failure is rare on a clean corpus — itself a positive finding). When labeled
  `ungrounded` traces accumulate from real usage, replay those queries with --best-of 3
  and report the adoption rate; promote the flag to default-on only with that number.

## Open — dev-loop fuel & measurement (makes the loop compound)

- ◦ **(follow-up) outcome labels for the remaining cli.local surfaces** — `muse ask` now
  labels every trace (see Done 2026-06-10); still `grounded:null`: ask `--json` mode and
  `--image` (the verdict doesn't run there by design), and `muse chat --local` (the chat
  gate is the sync NUMBER-only check, a different verdict shape). Label chat-local when
  the error-analysis fuel from ask proves insufficient — don't build ahead of need.
- ⏳ **`error-analysis.mjs` — cluster `.muse/runs` failures into a ranked taxonomy**
  — the missing ANALYZE half. BLOCKED on the instrumentation above (no labels = no
  Pareto; clustering a passing-looking corpus with the same 8B is maker=judge theater).
  Defer until ~20-30 real labeled failures exist. Source: eval-driven-dev research
  (Husain/Yan; Google "every user report → permanent test case").
- ◦ **Split the eval scoreboard into TRAJECTORY vs FINAL-RESPONSE axes** (Google ADK:
  EXACT/IN_ORDER/ANY_ORDER match modes + separate final-response score) so a regression
  localizes to path-vs-answer. Pure refactor of `scripts/eval-harness.mjs`.
- ✓→Done **`hallucinations_v1`-style per-sentence groundedness** — finer than the answer-level
  gate: labels each sentence supported/unsupported so the fuel names WHICH sentence was
  un-groundable. Source: Google ADK eval criteria.
  [DONE 2026-06-12, cognition loop fire 5+6: labeler + LIVE-wired into the ask grounding-gap
  fuel HINT. fire 6 added `worstUnsupportedSentence` + wired it so a grounding-gap weakness
  records the worst un-groundable sentence as its ledger `hint`. LIVE-PROVEN on the assembled
  CLI: "광합성 화학 반응식" → hint named the exact ungrounded formula sentence; abstains →
  hint named the refusal sentence. Realized via the real-usage weakness-fuel path (better than
  the originally-imagined eval:self-improving surface); "contradictory" label (NLI) stays deferred.]
  — [fire 5] the LABELER shipped:
  `reportSentenceGroundedness(answer, evidence, floor?)` in `@muse/agent-core`
  (`sentence-groundedness.ts`) — pure, reuses the gate's `lexicalTokens` + the
  `splitPreservingSentencePunctuation` splitter; per-sentence supported/unsupported by
  token-coverage ≥ floor (0.5), reports unsupportedCount + unsupportedFraction. Diagnostic
  only (no gate verdict changed). 9-case battery. NEXT: WIRE into eval:self-improving's
  report so a miss names the sentence; "contradictory" label needs NLI (non-deterministic,
  deferred — supported/unsupported is the deterministic core).

## Open — dev-loop hardening (from the 2026-06-08 will-it-work review)

- ◦ **Extend `groundedCases` to ALL battery corpora** — the `groundedCases` ratchet
  SHIPPED for the grounding corpus (see Done: a dropped case there now fails self-eval).
  Remaining: extend the count to the other golden sets (eval:tools, adversarial, plan-quality)
  whose cases live in their own files, so a dropped case in ANY battery regresses. Source: must-fix #3.
- ◦ **Backlog refill is the autonomy ceiling** — write-back records the provenance of
  the consumed item but does NOT mint net-new actionable work, so autonomy lasts ~the
  seed length (~7 fires) then degrades to gap-scout. The durable refill is error-analysis,
  which is BLOCKED on trace outcome-logging (the fuel accrues from Jinan USING Muse, not
  from dev fires). Not a single slice — a standing truth: when ★ OPEN runs low, a refill
  fire (gap-scout or a human direction) is itself the work. Source: review honest-ceiling.

## Open — agent core

- ✓→Done **Council consensus-outlier screen (MoA deception robustness, arXiv:2503.05856)** — [2026-06-13,
  cognition loop fire 28, PAPER-GROUNDED, Fable scout+judge] An A2A council peer is an EXTERNAL untrusted
  agent; a deceptive/off-topic peer's reasoning flowed straight into `synthesizeCouncilAnswer`'s synthesis
  prompt and the reverify judge then PASSED it (the lie IS the cited evidence — GROUNDED≠TRUE at the
  council hand-off). Added pure `screenCouncilOutliers` (per-member mean pairwise Jaccard support over
  CJK-aware `lexicalTokens`; quarantine below absFloor AND relFloor×median, panel≥3, majority-preserving
  cap floor((n-1)/2)), run inside `synthesizeCouncilAnswer` after dedupe (prompt + validPeerIds from `kept`;
  `CouncilAnswer.excludedPeers`). Subtractive on untrusted input; reverify/id-gate/floor unchanged.
  Scout avoided the DEAD `orchestrateAnswer` seam (zero prod callers) → wired the LIVE council. Fable judge
  FAILed v1 (inline `\w+` tokenizer ASCII-only → broken for Korean, Muse's primary language: deceptive
  Korean peer never screened) → fixed to CJK-aware `lexicalTokens` + jaccard(∅)→0 + Korean tests
  (counterfactual: 9 tests fail on the old tokenizer). agent-core 1815 green.
- ◦ **Council screen: cross-lingual similarity** — the fire-28 outlier screen uses lexical Jaccard, so a
  legitimate minority-LANGUAGE peer among a different-language majority has structurally-0 token overlap and
  is wrongly quarantined (documented limitation). Homogeneous-language panels (the common case) + the
  security-critical deceptive-peer case work. FIX needs an embedding-based cross-lingual similarity fallback
  (or a script-disjoint exception) — deferred (needs the embedder at the council seam).

- ✓→Done **Evidence-tallied playbook lifecycle (Memp, arXiv:2508.06433)** — [2026-06-13, cognition
  loop fire 27, PAPER-GROUNDED, Fable scout+judge] Playbook reward was a clamped NET scalar that
  conflated "never used" with "used 10× / 5↑5↓"; deprecation needed a near-pure losing streak;
  probation graduated on a single net-positive bump. Applied Memp's update regimen (public preprint;
  reimplemented): per-entry outcome TALLIES (`reinforcements`/`decays`) + `wilsonInterval` +
  `effectiveStrategyReward` (evidence-damped; legacy-identical without a tally) + `planStrategyLifecycle`
  (deprecate when wilsonUpper<0.4 & n≥5; graduate when probation & wilsonLower>0.5 & n≥3). Wired
  END-TO-END: `adjustPlaybookReward` (store) writes the tallies; the 4 production projections
  (`buildPlaybookProvider` + 3 commands-ask mappers) now CARRY them; `scoreStrategy`/`isAvoidedStrategy`/
  `isInjectableStrategy` consume them on the live `applyPlaybook` ranking path. Fable judge FAILed v1
  (the lifecycle was INERT — projections stripped the tallies) → completed the wiring + an assembled-path
  test (confident-bad {0,8} excluded THROUGH the real provider; counterfactual proves the stripped
  projection let it through). Playbook = prompt-ranking only (floor untouched). agent-core 1805 + autoconfigure 509 + cli 2528 green.

- ✓→Done **Multi-aspect verifier vote on the MoA fallback (BoN-MAV, arXiv:2502.20379)** — [2026-06-13,
  cognition loop fire 26, PAPER-GROUNDED, Fable scout+judge] When the MoA aggregator threw/returned empty,
  `orchestrateAnswer` blindly picked the `"thorough"` proposal — even if off-topic while another was on-point;
  no candidate was ever verified ("Bo-n" without "MAV"). Applied BoN-MAV (public CC-BY; reimplemented): NEW
  `verifier-vote.ts` — `aggregateVerifierVotes` (binary aspect votes, AggScore=approvals/count, argmax,
  deterministic tie-break, NaN-guarded) + `DEFAULT_ASPECT_VERIFIERS` (on-topic/substantive/non-hedging —
  relative ranking, NEVER abstains). Wired into the aggregator-failure fallback only (happy path byte-identical;
  no grounding/citation/abstention semantics touched). Fable judge PASS — reverted-to-HEAD proved the delta
  non-vacuous (off-topic thorough vs on-topic skeptic → skeptic). agent-core 1786 green.

- ✓→Done **Associative recall via Personalized PageRank (HippoRAG 2, arXiv:2502.14802)** — [2026-06-13,
  cognition loop fire 25, PAPER-GROUNDED, Fable scout+judge] Muse recall was isolated (cosine+BM25+ACT-R)
  with zero graph/spreading-activation structure. Applied HippoRAG 2 (public ICML 2025 preprint;
  reimplemented, no code copied): NEW `packages/agent-core/src/associative-recall.ts` — `buildNoteLinkGraph`
  (undirected weighted note graph, edge weight Σ 1/df(sharedToken), df===N excluded) + `personalizedPageRank`
  (deterministic power iteration, damping 0.5, dangling→teleport, mass-conserving). Wired opt-in into
  `rankKnowledgeChunksWithHop` (`associative?` flag): seed PPR with primaries, append top **PPR>0**
  graph-reachable bridges via the fire-22 query-relative-cosine fail-safe path (max-2, primaries
  byte-identical, flag-off no-op). Floor-safe (no verdict change). Fable judge FAILed v1 (missing PPR>0
  floor → appended unrelated PPR-0 notes; vacuous integration test) → remediated (PPR>0 floor + a
  non-vacuous test: bridge absent flag-off / present flag-on via the token chain / unrelated excluded,
  counterfactual-verified). agent-core 1772 green. NEXT: synonym edges + wire into CLI ask after a live multi-hop battery.

- ✓→Done **No needless judge escalation on sentence-opener connectives** — [2026-06-13, cognition loop
  fire 24, Fable-scout runner-up] `answerAssertsUnsupportedValue` flagged sentence-initial capitalized
  connectives ("However"/"Based"/"Therefore"/"Additionally", all absent from LEXICAL_STOPWORDS) as
  named entities → a needless value-escalation judge pass (wasted local inference) whenever an answer
  opened a sentence that way. Added `SENTENCE_OPENER_STOPLIST` to the named-entity filter; genuine
  wrong-entity/number/email drift detection is structurally untouched (preserved). Fable judge FAILed
  the first attempt (positive tests were vacuous — used a THROWING judge that the fail-open escalation
  swallowed); remediated to `async () => false` so the verdict differs, and counterfactual-verified
  (revert src → the 3 opener tests now FAIL). agent-core 1760 green.

- ✓→Done **Second-hop retrieval no longer inflates CRAG confidence** — [2026-06-13, cognition loop
  fire 22, Fable-scout-found] `rankKnowledgeChunksWithHop` appended hop "bridge" matches carrying a
  SEED-relative cosine, but `KnowledgeMatch.cosine` is contractually "cosine to the QUERY" (the CRAG
  confidence signal). An inflated bridge (a near-duplicate note ~0.95 to the seed but ~0.48 to the
  query) flipped a weak retrieval to "confident" → suppressed the LOW-confidence warning + defeated
  the proactive stay-quiet gate + could fire phantom clarifications. FIX: recompute each appended
  bridge's cosine against the ORIGINAL query (embed query once via options.embed — cache hit in
  prod; prefer the chunk's embedText for the consistent space); FAIL-SAFE to cosine:0 on any embed
  error (a bridge must never RAISE confidence). Verdict logic untouched (input repair, IMMUTABLE-CORE
  safe). Fable judge reverted-to-HEAD to PROVE the regression bites (0.9997→"confident" pre-fix,
  0.48→"ambiguous" post). agent-core 1753 green.

- ✓→Done **MoA orchestrator: honest contributor attribution** — [2026-06-12, cognition loop fire 7,
  multi-agent #3] the MoA aggregate path set `contributors = all proposers`, but the field is
  documented as "ids the synthesized answer ACTUALLY drew on" and the aggregator discards off-topic
  proposals — a MAST reasoning-action-mismatch (the audit trail over-claimed). Added
  `attributeContributors(merged, proposals, floor=0.4)` (a proposer counts only when the merge
  lexically covers ≥floor of its tokens; fallback to all if none clear it) wired into the multi-merge
  return only. Other return paths (single / single-survivor / aggregator-empty) were already correct.
  agent-core 1708 green incl. a non-vacuous regression (3 proposers, merge echoes 2 → exactly 2 credited).

- ✓→Done **A2A council: typed + length-bounded response boundary** — [2026-06-12, cognition loop
  fire 8, multi-agent #3] the council REQUEST hand-off had a typed `parseCouncilRequest`, but the
  RESPONSE (the direction that flows into the initiator's LOCAL synthesis) was an inline ad-hoc check
  with NO length bound — a buggy/compromised allowlisted peer could flood local synthesis context
  (the wire's "bounded compute" goal wasn't enforced on the accepting side). Added a symmetric
  `parseCouncilResponse` + `MAX_COUNCIL_REASONING_CHARS` (truncate over-long reasoning at the trust
  seam) wired into `requestCouncilReasoning`. fromPeerId is carried-through (NOT a rejection reason —
  the judge caught + relaxed an over-strict draft that would have dropped legitimate reasoning when a
  peer's selfPeerId is unset, which handler.ts emits as ""). a2a 141 green.

- ✓→Done **Council synthesis: one member, one voice (per-peer dedup)** — [2026-06-12, cognition loop
  fire 9, multi-agent #3] `synthesizeCouncilAnswer` fed raw utterances into the synthesis without
  deduping by peer — a duplicate peerId (dup registry entry, or the initiator's selfId colliding with
  a peer id, both reachable via `gatherCouncil`) double-weighted that member (MAST duplicated-work,
  skews a deliberation). Added pure `dedupeUtterancesByPeer` (last-wins, order-preserving) applied at
  the synthesis boundary. agent-core 1712 green incl. a prompt-capture integration (dup peer → the
  synthesis prompt shows the LAST reasoning once, 2 members not 3).

- ✓→Done **Background memory consolidation (sleep daemon)** — [DONE 2026-06-13, cognition loop
  fires 10-12+16, background #5] `consolidationPlan` (recall promote/fade) only ran on the manual `muse
  memory consolidate` CLI — the daemon consolidates the PLAYBOOK but never MEMORY. fire 10 shipped
  the brake-first gate `shouldConsolidateMemory({nowMs,lastRunMs,newHitsSinceLastRun,…})` in
  `@muse/memory` (run only when ≥minNewHits material AND ≥minIntervalMs since last run — non-straining;
  10-case battery). fire 11: `planMemoryConsolidationTick(records, state, options)` — the pure
  decide-and-run unit: counts recall records re-engaged since lastRunMs (the new material), gates on
  the brake, and only then DELEGATES to consolidationPlan, returning {ran, plan?, nextState} (lastRunMs
  advanced only when it ran). 7-case battery (incl. plan==consolidationPlan delegation + both brakes).
  fire 12: WIRED into the daemon — `runMemoryConsolidationTick` (sibling fn, testable) reads recall
  hits → planMemoryConsolidationTick → logs promote/fade, registered as a daemon tick next to
  playbookConsolidateTick (MUSE_SELFLEARN_ENABLED-gated, fail-soft, in-closure lastRunMs). Background
  memory consolidation now RUNS on the daemon schedule (brake-gated). fire 16: promotion-PERSISTENCE
  — `runMemoryConsolidationTick` gains an optional `persist` dep; the daemon binds it to the existing
  `promoteRecalledMemories` (idempotent: clears prior PROMOTED_FACT_ + writes the current top-N into
  the persona; non-destructive, never touches real user facts, never outbound) behind a DEDICATED
  opt-in flag `MUSE_SLEEP_PROMOTE` (default OFF ⇒ report-only preserved). So with the flag on, the
  daemon graduates the most recall-useful memories into the always-on persona in the background,
  brake-gated. cli 2520 green (persist-on-brake-pass, not-on-fail/disabled, fail-soft on throw).
  (ACT-R ranking from T2-1 feeds the selection via useActrRanking.) #5 thread COMPLETE.

- ✓→Done **MoA fan-out: no duplicated sub-agent work (dedupe roles by id)** — [2026-06-12, cognition
  loop fire 13, sub-agents #4] `orchestrateAnswer` ran every role as a parallel proposer without
  deduping by id — duplicate-id roles ran a redundant sub-agent (wasted inference) AND yielded dup-id
  proposals that corrupt fire-7's `attributeContributors`/`contributors`. Added pure `dedupeRolesById`
  (first-wins, order-preserving) at the roleList resolution. MAST "no duplicated sub-agent work".
  agent-core 1718 green incl. an integration (2 dup-id roles + 1 → exactly 2 proposals, unique ids).
  DEFAULT_ROLES path unaffected (distinct ids → no-op).

- ✓→Done **MoA fan-out: empty proposer output → failedRoles (failure surfacing)** — [2026-06-12,
  cognition loop fire 14, sub-agents #4] `orchestrateAnswer` kept EVERY fulfilled proposer as a
  proposal, even one returning empty/whitespace text (a degraded sub-agent that didn't throw) —
  polluting the aggregator candidate list + inflating proposals.length. Now a fulfilled-but-empty
  proposal falls into `failedRoles` like a throw (MAST "failure propagation surfaces"). One-condition
  change (`&& outcome.value.text.trim().length > 0`); fail-close/single-survivor/aggregate/onProposal
  unchanged. agent-core 1722 green (empty→failedRoles, whitespace, all-empty fail-close, regression).

- ✓→Done **MoA aggregator failure resilience** — [2026-06-13, cognition loop fire 15, sub-agents #4]
  the proposers run under allSettled (resilient) but the AGGREGATOR call was unguarded — a flaky
  local-model aggregator throw REJECTED the whole orchestration, discarding every successful
  proposer's work. Wrapped `aggregate()` in try/catch → a throw becomes an empty merge → the EXISTING
  fallback returns the best proposal (the "thorough" one). MAST graceful-degradation / don't-lose-
  sub-agent-work. agent-core 1725 green (throws→resolves-with-proposal, empty→fallback, success→merged).

- ✓→Done **Weakness-ledger bounded growth** — [2026-06-13, cognition loop fire 23, Fable-scout
  runner-up] `writeWeaknesses` wrote all rows uncapped (unlike recall-hits' 5000-trim) → the ledger
  grew without bound as novel topic rows accrued. Added `MAX_WEAKNESS_ENTRIES=2000` trim: on overflow
  keep what the selectors surface (count desc, then recency), evict stale one-offs; under the cap =
  verbatim/unreordered. mcp 1683 green; Fable-judge PASS (under-cap order-pin non-vacuous, evictions genuine).

## Blocked / deferred

- ⏳ **Grammar-constrained tool-call decoding** — INFEASIBLE on Ollama today: `format`
  (schema→grammar) and `tools` are NOT composable (Ollama #6002). Revisit when #6002
  lands or accept an inference-stack change. Existing `groundToolArguments` already
  covers the fabricated-value class.

## Rejected directions (do NOT re-derive these)

- ✗ **Chase general agentic leaderboards (SWE-bench Verified / τ²-bench / BFCL) as the
  "best" claim.** A fixed ~12B local model loses by construction (best open-weight
  SWE-bench ~80% on 200B+ MoE; BFCL 8-14B ~66% vs ~88% frontier). Own the architectural
  grounding-DELTA niche instead — the one claim a bigger model can't beat by swapping in.
  (2026-06-08 review, 3 adversarial critics concurred.)
- ✗ **Build the error-analysis analyzer before instrumenting outcome-logging.** No fuel
  (labels) exists yet; building the pipeline first is infrastructure for a flywheel with
  no gas. Instrument first (above), analyze later.

## Open — browser control (low-spec model drives Chrome; track started 2026-06-11)

- ✓→Done **ask --with-tools tool-set diet** — maxTools 10 default (MUSE_ASK_MAX_TOOLS, 0/off
  uncaps); relevance-sorted top-N. MEASURED side win: browse turn 93s → 42s (smaller tool
  schemas = less prompt eval). Found+fixed en route: 1-char CJK keyword containment ("비" ranked
  weather on 비밀번호 prompts → exact-only) and weather's calendar words (내일/주말) outranking
  reminders.add. Probes: browse→browser_open, recall→grounded cite, reminder plan→reminders.add
  first; eval:tools 125/125. Follow-up below.
- ✓→Done **muse.* loopback keywords** — recall family keyworded (notes×6, tasks.search,
  reminders.search/history, episode.search; calendar/tasks-CRUD/reminders-CRUD already had them
  in a different def position — the audit's "no keywords" claim was PARTIALLY wrong). Plan probes:
  노트→muse.notes.search 1st, 지난번 대화→episode.search 1st, 할일 검색→tasks.search 1st.
  Still bare (low-traffic tail, fine): context/messaging/followup/pattern/status/skills.
- ◦ **ask latency on the browser path** — ~90s/turn measured (10K-token prompt eval ≈ 40s × 2
  rounds on gemma4). Levers: prompt diet under --with-tools (skip notes blocks on clear
  browse intent?), KV prefix reuse across rounds, smaller tool list (above).
- ✓→Done **injection-pattern cross-span tightening** — the EN role_override family + 2 KO
  role_override + 1 KO extraction regexes used unbounded `.*`/`/s`, so three unrelated words from
  DIFFERENT sentences combined into a false hit (live repro: "disregard the noise … finally …
  assembly instructions" → role_override, with `all` matching the substring inside "fin**all**y").
  Bounded the inter-token spans to `.{0,50}` (EN) / `.{0,30}` (KO, denser script) and word-boundary-
  anchored `all`. TDD: 3 cross-span false-positive cases (EN + KO) + a true-positive-preserved case;
  all 127 policy tests green incl. the multilingual battery (true positives intact), agent-core
  guards 1622, byte-hygiene 30, precheck:grounding pass^2. Real injections keep trigger→target→noun
  within a clause, so detection is unchanged; only the cross-sentence false combinations are killed.

- ✓→Done **same-origin iframe piercing** — the snapshot walk descends into same-origin
  iframe `contentDocument` (like shadow roots); cross-origin throws on access and is
  honestly skipped. Ref resolution searches EVERY frame (`page.frames()`), so an
  iframe-embedded control is both visible AND clickable. Real-Chrome smoke (local http,
  same-origin iframe button): button appears in the snapshot + cross-frame click succeeds.
- ✓→Done **empirical real-web hardening (probe → fix → lock)** — a gap-probe of 7 real
  patterns on puppeteer-core 25.1.0 / Node 24 surfaced 3 bugs, all fixed + locked in
  smoke:browser (now 12 scenarios): ① a JS dialog (confirm/alert/prompt) BLOCKED the
  page → the next action hung to the timeout; now auto-accepted (the act was draft-first
  approved upstream) + reported in the snapshot `dialog` field. ② content inserted by
  setTimeout/fetch AFTER a click was missed (networkidle returns instantly with no
  network) → a MutationObserver-based `settleDom` waits for the DOM to go quiet (fast on
  static pages, capped). ③ disabled controls were listed (wasted clicks) → skipped in the
  walk. Verified: unit 36, smoke 12/12 exit 0, eval:browser-agent PASS.
- ✓→Done **new-tab following + autocomplete** (probe batch 2) — a target=_blank link /
  window.open popup spawned a tab the controller never followed (it kept observing the
  stale opener; window.open even hung 8s). Fix: arm a `targetcreated` listener BEFORE the
  click/submit (checking pages() after races and misses it) and adopt the new tab, within
  a 500ms window so a normal no-new-tab click isn't taxed (2943ms → 1446ms). Autocomplete
  (type → suggestion) already works via the DOM-stable settle. Locked: smoke 13 (new tab
  followed) + 14 (autocomplete observed); unit 36, eval:browser-agent PASS.
- ✓→Done **repeated-control targeting** (probe batch 3, click/select) — a per-row
  "Add to cart" / repeated "View" was DEDUPED to one entry, so the model could never
  target the 2nd (product lists, tables, search results — a huge real-web class). Fix:
  (a) dedup now collapses only TRULY redundant LINKS — same text AND same href (a
  responsive nav rendered twice); distinct buttons/actions are kept. (b) matcher gained
  ORDINAL targeting ("the second Add to cart", "2nd View", "last") that picks the Nth
  among equally-matched controls in DOM order — guarded so a literal label that starts
  with an ordinal word ("First name") is never mis-stripped (only applies when `rest`
  truly has >1 match). Custom (non-native) dropdowns + tabs already worked (settle).
  Locked: matcher unit +5, smoke 15 (repeated buttons distinct + ordinal→Banana), agent
  battery PASS.
- ✓→Done **browser_hover** (probe batch 4) — hover-triggered dropdown navs / tooltips were
  invisible (the submenu only renders on :hover/mouseover). New read-risk `browser_hover`
  tool grounds a target (the menu label) and moves the pointer over it, then re-observes —
  the pointer STAYS, so a nested submenu item stays clickable (moving to it keeps :hover).
  Also added `[aria-haspopup]` to the snapshot selector so explicit (possibly non-link)
  menu triggers are listed. Locked: unit +2, eval 10/10 STABLE 3/3 (hover→browser_hover,
  not click), smoke 16 (hover reveals Billing then clicks it), agent PASS. (Limit: a hover
  trigger that's a bare non-interactive `<div>` without aria-haspopup still isn't listed.)
- ✓→Done **form-control labels** (probe batch 5) — a radio/checkbox/labeled input was
  named by its `value`/`name` attr ("pro"), NOT its VISIBLE label ("Pro plan"), so the
  model — which refers to controls by their label — couldn't target them. Fix: a form
  control's name now resolves its accessible label (aria-labelledby → `<label for>` →
  wrapping `<label>`) before falling back to value/placeholder. Also added `[role=option]`
  / `[role=switch]` to the snapshot selector (custom listboxes/toggles with JS-delegated
  handlers, no inline onclick). Verified: radio→"Pro plan", input→"Email address",
  checkbox→"I agree to terms" all targetable + actionable; range sliders already settable
  via type/fill. Locked: smoke 17, unit 43, agent PASS.
- ✓→Done **browser_key** (probe batch 6) — no keyboard action meant a modal/dropdown with
  no visible close control could not be dismissed, and keyboard-driven UIs were unreachable.
  New read-risk `browser_key` tool presses Escape / Enter / Tab / arrows, then settles +
  re-observes (Enter wrapped in the new-tab follow). Verified: a modal opened by a button
  and closable only by Escape is dismissed; Tab fires its handler. Locked: smoke 18, eval
  11/11 STABLE 3/3 (Escape→browser_key, not click), unit 46, agent PASS.
- ✓→Done **multi-step agent reliability** (the frontier) — eval:browser-agent was a single
  1-2-step task; added a genuine multi-step scenario (open → search → CLICK the result →
  read the DETAIL page → answer the stock count that appears ONLY there). gemma4:12b carries
  the full chain STABLE 3/3 (terminal state = ended on the detail page; grounded answer = the
  "7 units" that's unreachable without clicking; fabricating or stopping at the results fails).
  Proves low-spec multi-step web autonomy is reliable, not just one-shot. The battery is now a
  scenarios[] array — add a scenario per new capability.
- ◦ **more real-web probes** — native file upload (`<input type=file>` → CDP uploadFile +
  path arg/tool), cross-origin iframe (per-frame contexts — scope honestly), drag-and-drop;
  and harder multi-step chains (3-4 clicks, a form fill across pages).
- ✓→Done **browser_scroll** — the snapshot only saw rendered DOM, so below-the-fold /
  lazy-loaded content (infinite feeds, long lists) was invisible. New read tool scrolls
  (down/up/top/bottom) + settles + re-observes. Unit (enum + reject-unknown + scrolls);
  eval 9/9 STABLE 3/3 (scroll EN+KO); real-Chrome smoke: a button lazy-appended on scroll
  is absent before and present after scroll('bottom'). Completes the observation-
  completeness trio with iframe + paging.
- ✓→Done **element paging past the 50 cap** — no more silent truncation. The controller
  collects up to BROWSER_ELEMENT_CEILING (200) so grounding matches the WHOLE set in code;
  every tool RESPONSE shows ≤BROWSER_MAX_ELEMENTS (50) and reports `total` +
  `hasMore`/`nextOffset`; `browser_read` gained an `offset` arg to page. Unit: 50-cap +
  total/nextOffset + offset-reads-the-rest; smoke: 61 elements returned (not capped at 50).
- ✓→Done **agent-level multi-step live battery** — `pnpm eval:browser-agent`: gemma4 drives
  open→type+submit on a local fixture shop (file://, no network) and answers from the rendered
  result; graded on TERMINAL STATE (the page records the query it actually received — a
  fabricated "I searched" cannot pass) + answer must carry the name+price that only render
  post-search. 3/3 STABLE. Built it the hard way: ① matcher bug — "search box" landed on the
  'Search' BUTTON (substring 60 > shared-words 35); type-intent now prefers ANY matching
  typeable element. ② harness initially omitted metadata.localMode → runtime hid the
  execute-risk type/click and gemma FABRICATED a result ("Wireless Mouse Pro $29.99") —
  recorded evidence that the gate-less raw model invents on tool failure; the ask path's
  verdict gate is the standing protection. ③ launchDetached probe window 10s→30s (a fresh
  profile's cold start exceeded 10s under load — "slow" misread as "missing").

## Done (recent — newest first)

- ✓ 2026-06-12 **file_read — "다운로드에 있는 PDF 요약해줘" 원샷** (tool-audit batch #4, the last):
  ONE read-risk tool, default under --with-tools. The model NAMES the file ("invoice pdf"); code
  grounds it — Downloads/Desktop/Documents walk (depth 3, no dotfiles), exact>prefix>contains>words
  ranking, newest-first ties; unmatched ⇒ recent-files list, never a guess; absolute path outside
  the roots ⇒ refused (muse.fs allowlist posture); >25MB refused; text capped 20K chars. PDF text
  via lazily-imported pdfjs-dist 6 (Apache-2.0; v6 dropped font-eval entirely). Proof: mcp 1606
  unit (10 new, TDD); NEW gate `pnpm eval:file-read` — headless Chrome GENERATES a real PDF →
  real pdfjs extraction → tool round-trip + fail-closed bounds, 6/6; eval:tools new file scenario
  5/5 STABLE 3/3 (spotlight/notes-recall/no-tool confusables); FULL eval:tools 130/130; LIVE e2e —
  a real contract PDF in ~/Downloads summarized with all three terms correct. Follow-ups: .docx/
  .hwp extraction · file kind by content-sniff not extension · file_read content into the
  grounding-evidence path with a [from FILE] cite.


- ✓ 2026-06-11 **mac_screen_read — "지금 화면에 뭐 떠있어?" 원샷** (tool-audit batch #2): screencapture →
  injected LOCAL vision callback (describeImage in agent-core: abstention-prompted free-text, fail-soft,
  never invents) → text; @muse/macos stays model-free (CLI binds gemma4 lazily via a holder ref since
  actuator tools build before the assembly). risk:read, behind MUSE_MACOS_ACTUATORS. mac_screenshot gained
  the not-when line (file vs describe). Proof: agent-core 1622 + macos 66 unit; eval:tools mac scenario
  28/28 STABLE 3/3 (2 new cases incl. the screenshot confusable); LIVE e2e described the real screen
  (Chrome+Example Domain+popup) accurately. ALSO from the audit: clipboard READ already existed
  (mac_app_read app='clipboard', eval-covered) — no duplicate tool built; live e2e returned pbcopy'd
  text verbatim.


- ✓ 2026-06-11 **browser: LIVE end-to-end — `muse ask`가 실제로 Chrome을 부린다** (4 commits):
  driving the REAL front door exposed a chain of four blockers, each fixed + verified live:
  ① injection input guard self-blocked every --with-tools ask (its own anti-injection guidance
  quotes attack strings; now scans USER messages only). ② browser_open/back were execute-risk →
  hidden without --actuators (now read; reads are free). ③ the ask prompt's "USING ONLY the
  notes" lock beat the armed tools (forked under --with-tools). ④ num_ctx 8192 vs 32K-budget
  mismatch → prompt truncated to done_reason:length, EMPTY answer (DEFAULT_OLLAMA_NUM_CTX=32768,
  live-verified the runner honours request num_ctx). PLUS: puppeteer.launch child pinned the
  event loop (ask answered then hung forever) → Chrome now spawns DETACHED and every invocation
  CONNECTs via DevToolsActivePort; ask disconnects post-run. Toolchain: Node 24.16 (nvm default),
  puppeteer-core 25.1 (clickCount→count), Locator API on click/type. PROOF: back-to-back live
  asks — ASK1 93s exit 0 (browser_open, grounded, external-source cite), ASK2 92s exit 0
  (reconnects, browser_read reads the SAME page). smoke:browser 13/13; pnpm check exit 0 on
  Node 24; precheck:grounding pass^2. LESSON: eval:tools 7/7 ≠ the surface works — only driving
  the assembled path catches exposure/prompt/window/process-lifecycle blockers.

- ✓ 2026-06-11 **browser: see the real web — SPA settle + shadow DOM + <select> grounding**:
  bounded settle-and-retry (`looksUnsettled`, 2×700ms) so late-rendering SPAs aren't a blank
  page; composed-tree walk + `pierce/` ref resolution so open shadow roots are observed AND
  actable; `browser_type` on a dropdown grounds the option in code (`matchOption`, fail-close —
  unmatchable option throws, page untouched); position:fixed controls no longer filtered
  (offsetParent check dropped); +combobox/searchbox/checkbox/radio/menuitem/tab roles.
  NEW standing gate `pnpm smoke:browser` (real headless Chrome, file:// fixtures, no network,
  skip-if-no-Chrome) 10/10. Tool-description fix: browser_open gained the "NOT for acting on
  the already-open page" line — the KO type case was 0/3 ON THIS MACHINE even at HEAD (the
  7/7 STABLE claim didn't reproduce — T=0 varies across machines); now 7/7 STABLE 3/3, full
  eval:tools 97/97. Also: removed a raw NUL byte committed into puppeteer-controller.ts
  (git saw the file as binary; byte-hygiene).

- ✓ 2026-06-11 **fresh-pass batch #2-#4**: README model-claim drift fixed (identity doc said
  qwen3:8b default — stale since 6/7; EN+KO). Duplicate date/time prompt line dropped on persona
  turns (~20 tokens/turn). **ask stage-latency instrumentation** (createStageTimer →
  trace `timings` + MUSE_TIMINGS=1 stderr): FIRST real breakdown = retrieval 0.2s (0.7%) ·
  generation 20.2s (75%) · verdict 6.5s (24%) of 26.8s — perf work should target generation
  (KV prefix env, sleep-compute) and reverify cost, NOT retrieval. Known-flake note: synthetic
  EN-weather case invents a tool name ~1/3 at temp 0 (pre-existing; REPEAT=3 surfaces it).
- ✓ 2026-06-11 **fresh-pass #1: --json carries the gate verdict** — the verdict now computes in
  json mode too (emissions stay non-json; best-of stays inert there); payload gains
  `groundedVerdict`; json traces now carry REAL labels instead of null (more error-analysis
  fuel). Live-verified. Closes half of audit CLI #8 (dead verdict under --json).
- ✓ 2026-06-11 **F9(half): SDT-adaptive proactivity criterion** — Green&Swets likelihood-ratio
  criterion as code: `sdtCriterion` (Laplace-smoothed, bounded β) + `adjustConfidenceFloor`
  (acceptance-region scaling) + `summarizeNoticeResponses` (done/snooze=acted, dismiss=noise,
  from the existing ↩-reply markers). WIRED live: the daemon's pattern tick now adapts the
  0.7 firing floor per the user's own response history (≥3 responses; fail-soft to default).
  A dismiss-heavy pattern category self-suppresses; an acted-on one fires more readily. 4/4.
- ✓ 2026-06-11 **Maturity-review do-next batch (#1-#5 ALL shipped)**: ① dead ACT-R wired (recall-hit
  ledger → Petrov-2006 approximation, hot episode outranks cold; 3fb1b95d). ② multi-hop measured
  REAL (joint@4 2/6) → deterministic second-hop ships 4/6 with single-hop hit@1 15/15 preserved
  via augment-never-displace (df9dc99b). ③ contextual chunk annotation (embedText, bare-value
  probe 5/6→6/6, both rank paths + persisted index; 4f237b95). ④ prompt-budget ENFORCEMENT
  (priority eviction, opt-in MUSE_PROMPT_TOKEN_BUDGET; 8b5a18ed). ⑤ multi-agent subtract-then-type:
  race PARKED (wire-compat → sequential, runRace deleted), parseWorkerResult typed boundary on all
  seams, and the FIRST live orchestration battery (eval:orchestration — injected failure
  propagates, bounded termination, fan-in survives; PASS on gemma4 in 2.3s).
  Remaining from the review: block-ablation arm (feeds/reflection) — queued.

- ✓ 2026-06-10 **AUDIT FIX (HIGH-adjacent): non-TTY fail-close unified across ALL actuator gates**
  — the stores/safety audit found web/email/home approval gates lacked the non-interactive deny
  the messaging gate had (outbound-safety rule 2: an undeliverable confirm must deny — a piped
  stdin byte must never act as the confirmation keypress). buildWebApprovalGate /
  buildEmailApprovalGate extracted with the shared contract; approvals re-run threads
  isInteractive (headless approve stays fail-close). 3 new gate tests; CLI 2455 green.
- ✓ 2026-06-10 **F7 semantic entropy: NEGATIVE result, recorded** — discrete SE (Nature 2024)
  AUROC 0.375 vs retrieval-confidence baseline 0.813 on answerable-vs-refuse: Muse's
  abstention-trained prompt makes refusals CONSISTENT ("NOT IN NOTES" × k), so sample
  scatter never appears — SE adds no signal here; do not adopt
  (docs/benchmarks/RESULTS-semantic-entropy.md, scripts/eval-semantic-entropy.mjs kept for re-runs).

- ✓ 2026-06-10 **Top-5 batch (Jinan-directed "do all 5")**: ① reverify judge now
  format-CONSTRAINED on all 4 call sites (REVERIFY_RESPONSE_FORMAT + parseGroundingReverifyJson,
  fail-close, legacy YES-parse fallback; precheck:grounding pass^3 live) — a verdict can no longer
  be lost to parse drift. ② source-trust DECIDED (option B) + shipped: the verified-sources block
  heading names itself external/tool-fetched (KO/EN), tool evidence carries trusted:false.
  ③ multi-turn query rewriting (needsContextualRewrite → one constrained inference → retrieval-only
  rewrite, fail-open): LIVE 2-turn proof — "그거 언제 바뀌었지?" resolved the anaphor and answered
  6월 2일 [from wifi.md]. ④ plan-cache reuse Jaccard→embedding blend
  (selectPlanExemplarByRelevance, cosine floor 0.75, fail-open lexical; wired via createGateEmbedder
  whose fallback also moved to the v2-moe default). ⑤ self-eval case ratchet extended to ALL golden
  sets (toolCases=84, adversarialCases=16, planCases=10). Gates: pnpm check exit 0 · CLI 2452 ·
  agent-core 1583 · autoconfigure 503 · lint 0/0 · precheck:grounding pass^3.
- ✓ 2026-06-10 **Lever #1 SHIPPED — multilingual embedder default + one-time legacy migration**
  (6caaa6ac): measured A/B (eval:embedder-ab, production ranking config, paraphrase queries) —
  v1 `nomic-embed-text` KO hit@1 **50%** vs `nomic-embed-text-v2-moe` **100%** (EN 100% too,
  no regression; embeddinggemma 92%). Default flipped (env `MUSE_EMBED_MODEL` overrides; leaf
  module `embed-model-default.ts`; 20 literals swept). `resolveIndexModel` migrates a
  LEGACY-default index once (live-verified on the real index); custom models preserved. All
  grounding batteries green ON THE NEW EMBEDDER (pass^3, Δ+0.94, chat 1.00/0.00).
  NOTE for the setup-language idea: one multilingual default serves KO+EN, so no setup
  language question is needed for the embedder; reply language remains a persona pref.
- ✓ 2026-06-10 **Lever #3 SHIPPED — ollama-perf doctor posture + stable-prefix prompt ordering**
  (c76ad9ba + part of 6caaa6ac): `muse doctor` advisory for OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION/KV_CACHE_TYPE
  (reads process env + macOS launchd); ask's volatile prompt lines (time, retrieval guidance)
  moved BELOW the stable instruction block so Ollama's KV prefix reuse survives across turns.
  Residual: TTFT effect not isolated (needs control of the user's Ollama.app env — measure
  after Jinan sets the env vars).
- ✓ 2026-06-10 **Chat grounding parity — reverify escalation on the front-door surface**: the
  chat gate's borderline bands (weak retrieval, coverage-only failure, unsupported asserted
  value) now spend the SAME one-shot reverify judge ask uses (`gateChatAnswerWithReverify`,
  shared `chatGatePrecheck` keeps the deterministic number/email/quote checks identical; the
  judge fires ONLY on those bands — zero extra inference on a normal grounded turn; fail-close
  on judge error). Closes the recorded named-entity-drift-on-chat gap via the value-escalation
  band. TDD 6/6; CLI suite 2436 green; precheck:grounding pass^3; eval:chat-grounding
  faithfulness 1.00 / false-refusal 0.00; live chat round-trip cited. Sync `gateChatAnswer`
  stays (eval + no-provider fallback).
- ✓ 2026-06-10 **Multi-agent handoff fail-close (`validateWorkerHandoff`)**: a BLANK worker
  output no longer flows downstream as "completed" (MAST information-withholding) — sequential
  marks the step failed and tells the next worker, parallel reports failed, race never lets a
  blank answer win, supervisor excludes the worker and falls through. Typed `WorkerHandoff` +
  6/6 tests (incl. failure-propagation assertions); multi-agent suite 75/75.
- ✓ 2026-06-10 **Agent-performance levers research pass** → ranked 12-lever list with sources +
  feasibility-on-Ollama-today at `docs/strategy/agent-performance-levers.md`; top 3 promoted to
  the Open section above.
- ✓ 2026-06-10 **Best-of-N recall shipped — the gate is now a SELECTOR, not just a filter**
  (`muse ask --best-of <n>`, 2-5): when the first draft fails the grounding verdict, redraw n-1
  fresh drafts, `selectBestGroundedDraft` (agent-core, deterministic rubric-sum ranking, "weak"
  never accepted, TDD 5/5) picks the best grounded survivor, and the FULL reverify-backed gate
  confirms it before it replaces the answer — fail-close, so resampling can only raise the
  answered rate at the same fabrication=0. Orchestration extracted as `drawBestGroundedRedraft`
  (4/4 unit, composed with the REAL selector). Gates: pnpm check all-workspace green, lint 0/0,
  precheck:grounding pass^3 3/3, eval:grounding-delta Δ+0.94 unchanged, live happy-path ×4.
  HONEST LIMIT: the live adoption path (🎯) never fired in 3 adversarial forcing attempts —
  measured follow-up recorded above. Source: backlog ◦ (arXiv 2504.04718 — small models can't
  self-verify; Muse's owned verifier selects instead).
- ✓ 2026-06-10 **Trace outcome-logging COMPLETE for `muse ask` — cli.local traces carry real labels**
  (the standing ★ PREREQUISITE): the ask path now writes a run-log trace per answered run with the
  top-level `grounded` label the run already computed — `abstain` (refusal), `grounded`/`ungrounded`
  (rubric verdict), `null` only where the verdict doesn't run (`--json`/`--image`). Pure
  `askOutcomeLabel` (TDD, 3/3) + writeRunLog wiring before the output split; full CLI suite 210
  files/2426 green; LIVE both polarities on gemma4 (혈액형→abstain, notes question→grounded, source
  receipt shown). Error-analysis fuel now accrues from real usage; the analyzer stays deferred until
  ~20-30 labeled failures exist.
- ✓ 2026-06-10 **improve-muse restructured: finder/recommender, not full build loop** — a real
  invocation ended with "할 게 없다" (the ★ refill had all shipped; remaining = 1 medium-risk ★ +
  2 ⏳-on-Jinan), exactly the autonomy-ceiling failure dev-loop.md §5 predicted. Per Jinan's direction
  the skill now runs ORIENT+FIND only and MUST end with a ranked recommendation ("nothing to do" is a
  forbidden output — empty backlog ⇒ the refill scout IS the candidate; blocked item ⇒ the surfaced
  decision IS the recommendation). BUILD→COMMIT stays in dev-loop.md §3 after the pick. GREEN-verified:
  a fresh subagent following the new skill against the same repo state produced 3 ranked candidates +
  the source-trust ⏳ as an A/B question + a clear 내 추천, no build, no "nothing to do".

- ✓ 2026-06-09 **pre-push hook fix** — the hook ran `exec pnpm` and blocked the push with
  "pnpm: not found" from a GUI/IDE git client (which spawns hooks with a minimal PATH where an
  nvm/corepack-installed pnpm is absent). Now resolves pnpm (with common-path fallback) and SKIPs
  (exit 0) if still unfound — fail-open on a broken hook environment, never block a push because the
  tripwire couldn't start. LESSON: a pre-push convenience hook must degrade to skip, not block.
- ✓ 2026-06-09 eleventh `improve-muse` fire (20-min loop) — **`noWrite` over-invocation scorer**:
  `toolScorers.noWrite(writeToolNames)` in eval-harness.mjs — reads allowed, any write/execute
  (actuator) tool fails. The IrrelAcc primitive `noTool` couldn't express ("report yesterday" may
  call a recall read but must never fire calendar_add). 14/14. The refill's 3 ★ are now all shipped.
- ✓ 2026-06-09 tenth `improve-muse` fire (20-min loop) — **groundToolArguments substring-hardening**:
  isGrounded now matches a value token at a WORD START (prefix), not as a raw substring — so a fabricated
  "art" is no longer grounded by "start the meeting", while morphology (meeting→meetings) and Korean
  particle attachment (강남역→강남역에서) still ground. Strengthens the deterministic anti-fabrication edge
  at the tool boundary. unit 12/12; live eval:tool-arg-grounding 2/2 (강남역 kept, fabrication dropped).
- ✓ 2026-06-09 ninth `improve-muse` fire (20-min loop) — **REFILL + outbound-safety guard test**:
  the clean backlog had drained, so FIND WORK (c) ran a gap-finding scout → 3 fresh clean ★ slices
  added (contacts negative-invariant, groundToolArguments substring-hardening, noWrite scorer). Then
  built the top one: resolve-contact.test.ts now pins that relationship/about/connections NEVER resolve
  a recipient (outbound-safety rule 3) — 7/7. The loop un-stuck itself via the prescribed refill.
- ✓ 2026-06-09 eighth `improve-muse` fire (20-min loop) — **NEGATIVE result, recorded**: tried the
  disjoint-drift sharpen on the SQuAD arm; it dropped Δ +0.63→+0.13 (catch 5/8→1/8), so verify-before-claim
  REVERTED it. Real finding: the SQuAD drift catch is high-variance (stochastic gemma reverify) — the
  single-run +0.63 is not stable; stabilize with pass^k before optimizing. A failed experiment caught and
  recorded, not shipped — the discipline working on a metric regression.
- ✓ 2026-06-09 seventh `improve-muse` fire (20-min loop) — **trace outcome-label schema**:
  writeRunLog now lifts `success`/`grounded` to the TOP LEVEL of every `.muse/runs` trace
  (readResponseSuccess/readResponseGrounded), so error-analysis can grep outcomes without
  descending into `response`. Additive (no existing test broke; 17/17). Foundation for the
  data flywheel; populating cli.local's `grounded` (medium-risk ask-path change) is the next sub-slice.
- ✓ 2026-06-09 sixth `improve-muse` fire (20-min loop) — **`groundedCases` ratchet**: self-eval
  now also counts the grounding-corpus CASES (29), so a dropped case fails self-eval, not just a
  dropped battery file (must-fix #3, for the grounding corpus). unit 9/9. Same fire surfaced the
  human-decision ceiling: source-trust → ⏳ (architectural fork, needs Jinan), trace-logging scoped
  (medium-risk persisted path). The loop is reaching the seed-drain / refill point honestly.
- ✓ 2026-06-09 fifth `improve-muse` fire (20-min loop) — **pick-evals matches grounding TEST
  files** (regex `grounded` added → `grounded-not-true.test.ts` now maps to the grounding
  batteries, not lint-only). Same fire RE-SCOPED the source-trust ★: a graph trace found
  tool-output produces `VerifiedSource` (response-filters path), SEPARATE from the grounding
  `KnowledgeMatch` set — so the wiring target was wrong; corrected before code was wasted.
- ✓ 2026-06-08 fourth `improve-muse` fire (first 20-min-loop iteration) — **source-trust
  FOUNDATION**: `KnowledgeMatch.trusted` provenance bit + pure `groundedOnUntrustedOnly`
  detector (additive — verifyGrounding/the gate untouched), agent-core, 7/7 tests. Live
  gate unchanged (eval:grounding-delta still Δ+0.94). The grounded≠true mitigation now has
  a foundation; wiring it through tool-output-evidence → recall → answer-marker is the next ★.
- ✓ 2026-06-08 third `improve-muse` fire — **grounded≠true boundary NAMED**:
  `packages/agent-core/src/grounded-not-true.test.ts` (3 cases, deterministic) locks that the
  gate marks a false-but-source-supported answer "grounded" (faithfulness is to the source,
  not truth) while STILL catching a fabricated citation (integrity protected). The biggest open
  hole is now a tracked, named property; the actionable mitigation (source-trust segregation)
  is the new top ★. testFiles 847→848.
- ✓ 2026-06-08 second `improve-muse` fire — **public-dataset grounding-delta arm SHIPPED**:
  `buildSquadGroundingCorpus` maps a pinned SQuAD-2.0 slice (8 paras, no model-generation —
  templated answers) → `eval:grounding-delta:squad` writes `docs/benchmarks/RESULTS-squad.md`.
  LIVE Δ+0.63 (gate ON 0.63 vs OFF 0.00) on gemma4 — the first EXTERNALLY-anchored architectural
  delta. unit 10/10; self-authored arm still Δ+0.94 (no regression).
- ✓ 2026-06-08 first real `improve-muse` fire: BUILD's verify-before-claim caught that the
  top item's "SQuAD-unanswerable→refuse" mapping yields Δ≈0 (refuse=retrieval-confidence;
  SQuAD-unanswerable is adversarially similar → stays confident). Re-scoped the item to the
  drift/answer-grounding path with templated answers, before any fixture work was wasted.
- ✓ 2026-06-08 `feat/grounding-ci-gate`: fabrication=0 grounded-surface ratchet (self-eval)
  · live pre-push grounding tripwire (`precheck:grounding`) · grounding-delta benchmark
  (`eval:grounding-delta`, Δ+0.94 gate ON vs OFF on gemma4) · self-eval ENOENT fix.
