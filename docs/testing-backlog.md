# Multi-faceted testing backlog

The test-hardening loop spent its first phase on **module unit-exhaustion**
(every export/branch of a chosen module, deterministic, dist-pre-verified).
The core is now saturated (~6,000 unit tests, 0 fail). That is the *shallowest*
testing layer. This backlog enumerates the **harder, higher-value layers** the
codebase still lacks, so the loop can pick a diverse target each fire instead of
hunting for the next thin module.

**Loop rule:** each fire, pick the highest-priority unchecked item whose
prerequisites are met, do ONE coherent slice of it (one commit), tick it (or add
a sub-bullet noting what's done / what remains). Keep the existing gates: own
check green → package suite → `pnpm lint` 0 → live gate where relevant. Prefer
depth on one item over touching several. When an item is genuinely exhausted,
mark it `[x] DONE` with the commit range.

Mock/fixture data MAY be created to drive a real code path, but the path must be
the REAL one against a contract-faithful fake — never a stubbed registry or a
happy-path-only assertion (per `outbound-safety.md`).

## P0 — agent-eval strategy (research-grounded — see `agent-eval-strategy.md`)

Best-practice for *agent* testing (DeepEval metric taxonomy, τ-bench terminal-
state eval, LLM-as-judge) + how hermes-agent (constraint gates on every variant)
and OpenClaw (dreaming shadow-trial before promotion) do it. These rank ABOVE
the generic layers below because they test what makes Muse an *agent*.

- [x] **A. ArgumentCorrectness battery** — `eval:tools` asserts the tool *name*;
  add a graded per-case check that the *arguments* are right (required present +
  values plausible). Cheapest high-value extension of the existing harness.
- [x] **B. Task-completion / terminal-state eval (τ-bench style)** — after a real
  run (diagnostic/local provider + contract-faithful tool fakes), assert the
  RESULTING STATE (note written / task added / approval recorded), not the path.
- [x] **C. Trajectory / step assertions** — ordered spans of a plan_execute /
  tool-loop run (plan → tool → synthesis) + adherence + step-efficiency.
- [x] **D. LLM-as-judge (GEval) harness** — reusable local-Qwen judge (temp 0,
  repeat) scoring open-ended outputs (summaries/drafts) vs a plain-English rubric.
- [x] **E. Adversarial eval battery** — prompt-injection / jailbreak / unsafe-
  tool-use as a scored must-refuse live battery (mirrors the eager-invocation
  negatives already in `eval:tools`).
- [x] **F. Constraint gates on self-authored skills (hermes-style)** — DONE (skill-review.ts size gate, wired into authoring producers). gate each
  session-authored skill on size (≤15 KB), tool-desc length, and a parse/lint
  check before it is loadable.
- [x] **G. Shadow-trial for memory/playbook promotion (OpenClaw-style)** — a
  report-only baseline-vs-candidate judge (verdict/reason/risk) before a distilled
  strategy or promoted memory goes live, kept separate from the live store.
- [x] **H. CI gating** — extend `self-eval` so a tool-selection / task-completion
  / adversarial regression FAILS the run, not just logs.

## P1 — assertion quality & failure modes (highest value: do these first)

- [ ] **Mutation testing baseline (StrykerJS).** 6,000 green tests prove
  *coverage*, not that the assertions *catch bugs*. Run Stryker on 2–3
  high-value packages (`agent-core`, `model`, `policy`) to get a mutation score;
  file the surviving-mutant hotspots as follow-up. NOTE: adds a devDep + config —
  needs human OK for the lockfile change before committing tooling; until then,
  do it as a throwaway local measurement and record the score here.
- [x] **Failure-injection / chaos on the model loop.** Drive `AgentRuntime.run`
  /`executeModelLoop` against a provider fake that returns 429 / 503 / a mid-
  stream `{error}` / a timeout / malformed JSON — assert retry classification,
  fallback policy, circuit-breaker open, and that a partial stream surfaces an
  error event (not a silent truncation). The "hardening" half of the human's
  directive. (Adapter-level retryable flags are already unit-tested; this is the
  *loop* composing them.)
  - [x] `executeModelLoop` throw-propagation (`b…` this commit): first-turn
    throw rejects; a later-turn throw rejects after the requested tool already
    ran; an unexpected `executeToolCall` throw propagates (NOT captured as a
    status:"error" tool result). 5→8 tests in execute-model-loop.test.ts.
  - [x] `AgentRuntime.run` end-to-end failure: a provider whose generate()
    throws persists a FAILED run record (handleRunError), fires the onError
    hook with the Error, and rethrows — never silently completes/swallows.
    (agent-runtime.test.ts, run-level composition.)
  - [x] `invokeModel` (the run() model-call seam) failure-injection: proves the
    real CLASSIFICATION (4xx fails fast — 1 attempt, no retry budget burned;
    429/503 + unknown/malformed-JSON errors are retried, via
    isRetryableProviderError + ModelProviderError.retryable) AND the COMPOSITION —
    persistent 503 exhausts retries → fallback strategy rescues; each
    exhausted-retry invocation is ONE breaker failure so the breaker opens and the
    next call short-circuits WITHOUT touching the provider. model-invocation.test.ts
    +5 (1011 pass). Pre-verified attempt/short-circuit counts via dist.
  - [x] Streaming mid-stream `{error}`: executeStreamingModelLoop SURFACES the
    error as an error event to the consumer (after the partial text-deltas it had
    already yielded — no silent truncation) AND records it on the tracing span
    (setError), THEN throws the same error instance — never reaching a false
    `done`. execute-streaming-model-loop.test.ts +3 (1014 pass). Pre-verified via
    dist that the error event is yielded before the throw.
- [x] **Tool-loop limits & runaway guards.** maxToolCalls, maxRunWallclockMs,
  maxToolOutputChars, tool-output recursion — exercise each cap end-to-end with a
  fake tool that tries to exceed it; assert the loop stops deterministically.
  (maxToolCalls + recursion: execute-model-loop.test.ts; maxToolOutputChars:
  cap-tool-output.test.ts; maxRunWallclockMs: execute-model-loop.test.ts —
  deadline cuts the loop, in-flight tool finishes, next turn gets no tools.)

## P2 — end-to-end flows (compose the pieces, not the units)

- [x] **Full agent run e2e (diagnostic provider).** message → model loop → tool
  call → tool result → synth, blocking AND streaming, asserting the whole chain
  (only ~6 e2e files today; expand the matrix: plan_execute, react, tool-error
  recovery, guard-block mid-run).
  - [x] plan_execute through the WHOLE AgentRuntime (not just streamPlanExecute):
    the REAL steerable DiagnosticModelProvider generates the plan + a REAL
    fs-mutating tool runs, exercising prepareInvocation → plan-execute streaming →
    finalizeInvocation. stream() asserts the runtime event sequence
    (plan-generated → executing → result → synthesis-started → text-delta → done)
    + plan adherence + terminal world state; run() asserts the same goal +
    a persisted `completed` run record. agent-run-plan-execute-e2e.test.ts (1016).
  - [x] react tool-loop through AgentRuntime.stream() with a REAL fs-mutating
    tool: the happy path streams tool-call → tool-result → text-delta → done and
    persists the note (terminal world state); TOOL-ERROR RECOVERY — a throwing
    tool surfaces a tool-result, the model synthesises a graceful answer, the run
    completes (not crash) and NOTHING is mutated. agent-run-react-stream-e2e.test.ts.
  - [x] guard-block MID-RUN (streaming): a toolApprovalGate denial inside the
    loop blocks an execute-risk tool — the gate is consulted, the block is
    surfaced as a tool-result (not a crash), the model synthesises a "can't
    without approval" answer, the run completes, and the gated tool NEVER ran
    (no side effect). agent-run-react-stream-e2e.test.ts. The full-agent-run
    matrix (plan_execute / react / tool-error recovery / guard-block) is closed.
- [x] **Approval-gate round-trip e2e.** A risky tool refused → pending-approval
  recorded → inbound "yes" reply → `runActuatorByName` re-runs through the
  fail-closed gate → action logged. Plus the deny / timeout / ambiguous-recipient
  paths produce NO external effect (outbound-safety acceptance, contract-faithful
  HTTP fake).
  - [x] The re-run leg (`runActuatorByName`) outbound-safety acceptance + the
    "recorded" rule (#4): web_action approve→`performed` / deny→`refused` /
    thrown-or-undeliverable approval prompt→fail-closed `refused` (no HTTP) /
    third-party 500→NOT a false success (`failed`, attempt fired once, no retry);
    email_send ambiguous recipient→no send, `refused` — each asserted by READING
    the action log (not just the HTTP effect). run-actuator-by-name.test.ts +5
    (mcp 1064). Contract-faithful HTTP fake.
  - [x] The chat-inbound half, composed end-to-end: the FOUR real seams wired
    together (createChannelApprovalGate refuses+records → pending-approval store →
    handleInboundApprovalReply on a "yes" → runActuatorByName re-run). A risky
    web_action is refused & recorded (+ a notice via a REAL registry +
    LogMessagingProvider), an inbound "yes" re-runs it for real (fetch fired once,
    logged `performed`) and clears it; a READ tool sails through unrecorded; a
    "yes" from a DIFFERENT source does not re-run (channel scope holds across the
    recorder→handler seam). approval-round-trip-e2e.test.ts (api 489).
- [~] **Route integration (boot the server).** The `apps/api/src/*-routes.ts`
  groups are registered but unexercised by direct tests (notes/tasks/reminders/
  messaging/voice/proactive/active-context/accountability/session/admin-*). Boot
  the Fastify app per group and assert status + body for the happy + 4xx paths.
  - [x] accountability route group (server.accountability.test.ts): /api/actions
    (newest-first), /api/objectives, /api/vetoes read-only + /api/contacts CRUD
    (POST persists, GET reflects, DELETE removes, 400 no-name). Most groups
    (notes/tasks/reminders/active-context/voice/today/setup/admin/chat) already
    have server.*.test.ts; remaining untested: the *-compat (Spring-compat) routes.
  - [x] admin-session-compat route group (server.admin-session-compat.test.ts):
    /api/admin/sessions/overview (status tally), the paginated list (limit/offset/
    total echo + items), session detail (+ empty tags), DELETE 204→404 (re-delete)
    + 404 unknown, tag POST 400 no-label. (auth-compat, session-compat, agent-compat,
    user-memory-compat, mcp-compat access-policy already covered by their server.*
    tests.) Remaining compat: admin-{analytics,observability,platform}-compat
    (ops/dashboard surfaces — lower outward value per the personal pivot).

## P3 — live LLM verification (Ollama up on this PC — USE it)

- [x] **`eval:tools:nl` baseline.** Run on qwen3:8b (this iter): native 7/7
  (100%) AND NL-protocol 7/7 (100%) across the time-tool confusable set — the
  text/Hermes tool protocol selects as reliably as native here, no weak NL spot
  to shore up. Baseline recorded; re-run after touching the NL tool protocol.
- [x] **`eval:self-improving` baseline.** Run on qwen3:8b (this iter): 8/8 live
  batteries GREEN — pattern-suggestion (③), preference-inference (②), skill-merge
  + playbook-merge (①), background-review + background-review-e2e (① engine),
  cited-recall (★ wedge), proactive-recall-gate (★ north star). No regression to
  shore up; this is the live-green baseline the loop had never captured.
- [ ] **`smoke:live` full completion.** Now that it streams (commit `6fd24d36`),
  run it to the end once with a generous timeout; confirm the slow tail
  (multi-agent orchestrate + CLI knowledge) is green, and append the result.
- [~] **`eval:tools` set growth.** Extend the actuator + time confusable sets and
  add more KO/adversarial cases (each pre-verified STABLE 3/3 before landing).
  - [x] 4 negative eager-invocation traps on the TIME confusable set (it had
    zero negatives): KO/EN musings with time/weekday WORDS ('금요일'/'Friday'/
    time idioms) that request no computation → NO tool. eval:tools 48/48 (100%)
    @ REPEAT=2; each STABLE 3/3.
  - [x] 5 negative eager-invocation traps on the STATE-CHANGING/perception
    actuator set (a false positive there acts/searches unbidden — the worst
    failure): KO smart-home comment, EN gratitude for a past booking, KO inbox
    venting, EN weather small-talk, KO weather-app-UI comment → all NO tool. The
    actuator scenario filter now keeps expectNoTool cases. eval:tools 44/44 (100%)
    @ REPEAT=2 on qwen3:8b; each pre-verified STABLE 3/3.

## P4 — generative & data-layer

- [ ] **Property-based / fuzz (fast-check).** Parsers/serializers/normalizers
  (env-parsers, gemini-live-protocol, web-search-policy, isApprovalReply,
  isLoopbackUrl, JSON repair) — assert invariants over generated input
  (round-trip, never-throws, idempotence). Zero today. (Adds a devDep — same
  lockfile caveat as Stryker.)
- [ ] **Real-Postgres behavior (testcontainers).** Only ~2 test files touch a real
  PG. The Kysely stores (runs, messages, tool-calls, approvals, checkpoints,
  traces) should have query-behavior tests against a real container, not just the
  in-memory store.
- [~] **Concurrency / races.** Atomic tmp+rename stores under concurrent writers,
  pending-approval cap under races, inbound dedup, single-flight daemons —
  interleave operations and assert no lost/duplicated/corrupt state.
  - [x] First slice + a real bug FOUND & FIXED: appendInbound (write-queue)
    preserves every record under 25 racing appends and isolates per-file;
    recordPendingApproval CRASHED with an ENOENT tmp-rename race (tmp name was
    `${pid}-${Date.now()}` → same-ms collision) — fixed with a random-uuid tmp
    suffix. Store now never crashes/corrupts under concurrency (last-writer-wins
    remains, documented). store-concurrency.test.ts (4 tests), full check green.
  - [x] Lossless serialization: a per-file mutation queue now serialises the
    whole read-modify-write of recordPendingApproval + clearPendingApproval, so
    25 concurrent records preserve ALL 25 (was last-writer-wins) and mixed
    concurrent clear+record resolves correctly. No more silent loss of a refused
    action's pending approval.
  - [x] Store-audit slice 2: audited all `${pid}-${Date.now()}`-tmp stores
    (~30) for the same race. Fixed `personal-action-log-store` (the immutable
    accountability trail, outbound-safety rule 4) — 25 concurrent appends were
    19/20 CRASHING + losing ~all; now per-file append queue + random-uuid tmp =
    0 crash, all 25 preserved, order kept. action-log-concurrency.test.ts.
  - [x] Store-audit slice 3: fixed proposed-action store (draft-first outbound
    proposals) — concurrent patch crashed 7/8 + clobbered; now 0-crash, all 8
    status patches applied + 12 concurrent proposes preserved. **The outbound-
    safety + audit critical trio is now concurrency-safe: pending-approval,
    action-log, proposed-action.**
  - [x] Store-audit slice 4 — recall-hits store (the recall-hit-recording flake
    seen earlier under parallel full-check load): had BOTH the `${pid}-${Date.now()}`
    tmp-rename crash AND the last-writer-wins read-modify-write (its own comment
    admitted "concurrent writers can clobber"). Fixed with randomUUID tmp + a
    per-file mutation queue: 25 same-key concurrent recalls now total 25 hits
    (was 1), 25 distinct keys all preserved, per-file isolated, 0 crash.
    recall-hits-store.test.ts +3, full `pnpm check` green. Closes the flake.
  - [x] Shared helper extracted (the recommended approach, not N copy-paste
    fixes): `atomic-file-store.ts` — `atomicWriteFile` (randomUUID tmp + fsync +
    rename + 0o600) and `withFileMutationQueue` (per-file read-modify-write
    serialisation, parallel across files, error doesn't wedge). 8 direct unit
    tests. First migration: personal-objectives-store (user-facing — a lost
    standing objective is an intent the daemon never acts on): addObjective +
    patchObjective now serialised, 20 concurrent registrations all preserved
    (was last-writer-wins), 20 concurrent patches all applied, 0 crash.
  - [x] Migration 2 — personal-consent-store (outbound-safety rule 5: a standing
    objective acts toward a third party ONLY with recorded scoped consent). Was
    pid+Date.now tmp + an unserialised recordConsent read-modify-write; now
    atomicWriteFile + withFileMutationQueue. 20 concurrent distinct grants all
    preserved (was last-writer-wins → 1) + each still individually checkable by
    the fail-closed gate, 15 concurrent re-grants of one id converge to a single
    record. +2 tests.
  - [x] Migration 3 — personal-veto-store (outbound-safety reversibility: a
    learned-avoidance the agent must not forget). recordVeto + removeVeto now
    serialised + atomicWriteFile: 20 concurrent distinct vetoes all preserved
    (still avoidance-checkable), 10 concurrent removes drop exactly the targeted
    ones. +2 tests. **The outbound-safety store trio consent+veto+the
    audit/approval stores is now concurrency-safe.**
  - [ ] Remaining: migrate the other ~14 read-modify-write stores
    (reminders / tasks / followups / playbook / episodes / proactive-history /
    contacts / patterns-fired / plan-cache / …) onto the shared helper —
    a cheap one-each adoption. inbound dedup + single-flight daemon race tests
    also open.

## P5 — surface & contract

- [~] **Prompt / tool-protocol snapshot tests.** Snapshot the rendered persona /
  system prompt and the Hermes tool-call wire format so an accidental prompt edit
  is caught (CLAUDE.md: "Snapshot-test prompt text and tool protocols when
  behavior matters").
  - [x] First snapshot: buildPlanningSystemPrompt (the behavior-critical planner
    prompt that shapes Qwen's plan output) pinned via toMatchInlineSnapshot +
    structural invariants. planning-prompt-snapshot.test.ts. (Was 0 snapshot
    tests in the repo.)
  - [x] buildSystemPrompt section-assembly snapshot (system-prompt-snapshot.test.ts): base → Response Format → cache boundary → memory/retrieved/tool sections, order + boundary placement pinned.
  - [ ] Remaining: the Ollama Hermes
    tool-call wire body (buildNativeChatBody) is already shape-asserted in
    adapter-ollama.test.ts — DONE — adapter-ollama.test.ts pins the exact native /api/chat body for a tool-using request.
- [x] **CLI command-parser + run-path smoke.** The untested commander
  registrations (commands-analytics/cost/latency/persona/voice/specs/tools-admin)
  — parse args + assert the action wiring via the CLI smoke harness. ALL SEVEN
  now covered (cost/latency/analytics/specs/voice/tools via inject-fake-helpers;
  persona via MUSE_PERSONA_FILE + injected stdin round-trip).
  - [x] `muse cost` (the richest path-builder of the group): parses daily/top/for
    and asserts the EXACT /api/admin/token-cost/* path the parser routes to —
    query-string assembly from --days/--limit (both/either/neither), and
    encodeURIComponent on the run id so a hostile `for "evil&admin=1 x"` can't
    inject extra query params (percent-encoded, not smuggled). Also: apiRequest
    result is handed to writeOutput; unknown subcommand + missing required arg
    are parse errors. commands-cost.test.ts +7 (cli 1496). Fake helpers, no network.
  - [x] `muse latency` + `muse analytics` (the sibling observability groups):
    summary/timeseries + failures/latency-distribution route to the exact
    /api/admin/metrics/latency/* + /api/admin/conversation-analytics/* paths;
    --days is percent-encoded (no param injection); apiRequest result → writeOutput;
    unknown subcommand is a parse error. commands-observability.test.ts +7 (cli 1503).
  - [x] `muse specs` (agent-spec registry: list / get / resolve): list → GET
    /agent-specs; get encodes the name (a hostile `../admin/secrets` →
    `..%2Fadmin%2Fsecrets`, no path traversal); resolve joins+trims the variadic
    prompt into a POST body and rejects an all-whitespace prompt (no request
    fires); unknown subcommand + missing <name> are parse errors.
    commands-specs.test.ts +6 (cli 1509).
  - [x] `muse voice` (providers + the rich tts path): providers → GET
    /api/voice/providers; tts shapes the POST body from the joined+trimmed text +
    options (voice/provider keys only when given), calls the injectable io.fetch,
    writes the BINARY audio response to --out (asserted on a tmp file) and prints
    the byte/format/provider line; an all-whitespace text is rejected before any
    fetch; a non-ok API status surfaces as an error with nothing written; missing
    required --out is a parse error. commands-voice.test.ts +6 (cli 1515).
  - [x] `muse tools` (tool-usage observability: stats / accuracy / calls /
    ranking): each subcommand routes to its fixed /api/admin/tools|tool-calls
    path and hands the result to writeOutput; unknown subcommand is a parse
    error. commands-tools-admin.test.ts +5 (cli 1520).
  - [x] `muse persona` (add/use/remove/show round-trip on a real store file via
    MUSE_PERSONA_FILE + injected readPipedStdin): add persists an inline or
    piped-stdin preamble; built-in-id collision + empty preamble are rejected
    (nothing written); use flips activeId + suggests on an unknown id; remove
    deletes a custom + resets active→default when it was active, and refuses a
    built-in; show returns the active/previewed preamble. commands-persona.test.ts
    +7 (cli 1527). **The CLI command-parser sweep is complete.**
- [~] **Config / schema validation fuzz.** Zod (or comparable) config + external-
  input validators against adversarial inputs (wrong types, extra keys, unicode,
  huge values) — assert they reject cleanly, never throw raw.
  - [x] env-parsers property fuzz (the boot-time external-input validators; the
    repo had ZERO property tests): a deterministic-LCG adversarial corpus
    (unicode / control chars / huge & precision-losing ints / hex·octal·sci
    notation / trailing garbage / very long strings) asserts the module's hard
    invariants over the whole space — NO parser ever throws; booleans stay
    boolean; int parsers return fallback-or-(safe-int satisfying >0/≥0); float
    parsers return fallback-or-(finite, in-range); csv/optional-string stay
    non-empty-trimmed-or-undefined; trailing-garbage/hex/unit-suffix tokens map
    to fallback (never silently coerced). env-parsers.test.ts +8 (autoconfigure
    436). (Confirmed int-vs-float precision contract differs by design.)
  - [x] isLoopbackUrl / classifyProviderLocality — the local-only EGRESS
    boundary (a misclassification = silent cloud egress the user asked to be
    protected from). Adversarial corpus proves the one-directional security
    invariant: string-appearance tricks (credentials/userinfo `localhost@evil.com`,
    subdomain `127.0.0.1.evil.com`, loopback token in path/query/fragment) are
    NEVER local; LAN/public/integer-IP-to-public hosts are NOT loopback; yet
    canonicalised loopback (integer/hex/octal IPv4 → 127.x) IS still recognised;
    cloud-id stays cloud even with a localhost URL; never throws on a 250-input
    generated junk corpus. local-only-policy.test.ts +4 (model 293).
  - [x] parseRunnerCommandRequest — the run_command arg gate that turns
    untrusted model tool-args into the request driving risky LOCAL execution
    (crates/runner boundary). Fuzz proves: for any JsonObject it EITHER throws a
    typed ToolRegistryError OR returns a well-typed request (command non-empty
    trimmed string; args all-strings; cwd non-empty string; env all-string
    values; byte/timeout caps positive integers) — never a raw crash; a hostile
    __proto__/constructor key never pollutes Object.prototype; mixed-type
    args/env are filtered to string entries (no coercion). tools.test.ts +3.
  - [x] decideWebSearchPolicy — the env+settings gate for whether web search
    (egress) is allowed + its use budget. Combinatorial fuzz (settings × override
    × env spelling × adversarial maxUses, ~13k combos) proves: never throws;
    output is ALWAYS { enabled: boolean, maxUses: positive integer } so a
    malformed budget (Infinity/NaN/float/0/neg/garbage) can't leak an
    unbounded/NaN allowance; a falsy MUSE_WEB_SEARCH (any case/whitespace) is an
    ABSOLUTE kill switch that override=true cannot re-enable. web-search-policy.test.ts +2.
  - [x] json-array-scan (extractFirstJsonArray / iterateJsonArrayCandidates) —
    the scanner that pulls a JSON array out of UNTRUSTED local-model plan/detector
    text. Property fuzz over a ~307-input LCG corpus (stray brackets, `]`-in-string,
    escapes, markdown `- [x]`, citations, prose, emoji): never throws; anything
    surfaced is a JSON-array SUBSTRING of the input; each iterate candidate's
    `.value` equals `JSON.parse(.text)`; extractFirst is exactly the first
    candidate (or null). json-array-scan.test.ts +2.
  - [ ] Remaining: fuzz gemini-live-protocol (the last named external-input
    validator).

## Done (this loop)

- [x] Module unit-exhaustion of the core: agent-core, model (adapters Ollama/
  Gemini/Anthropic + policies), messaging (approval gate), autoconfigure
  (registry-builders), mcp, apps/api (chat request→handler→response→plumbing→
  auth→doctor→poll-tick). ~6,000 unit tests, 0 fail.
- [x] `smoke:live` streaming fix (`6fd24d36`) — was buffered, not hung; verified
  17 checks green live.
- [x] `eval:tools` live baseline green (32→39 cases, `79fcee09`).
