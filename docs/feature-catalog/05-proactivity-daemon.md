# Domain 05 — Proactivity / Daemon / Sessions / Accountability

> Proactivity is an Attunement delivery substrate, not the closed loop. This snapshot does
> not prove observation → rhythm → friction → outcome adaptation. See the
> [Attunement roadmap](../goals/attunement-implementation-plan.md).

Catalogued 2026-06-14 against `main` (HEAD 2828a04b). CLI built (`apps/cli/dist/index.js`, 2026-06-13).
Verification: `node apps/cli/dist/index.js <cmd> --help </dev/null` for every command + read-only live runs.
NO daemon/server/webhook listener was started, no sends, no cloud calls.

---

## A. Background daemon (the resident process)

### `muse daemon` — one-process resident daemon ✅🧪
- **What**: Runs every enabled proactive sub-tick in a single process. `--once` runs one tick of each then exits; `--status` prints readiness; `--init` persists provider/destination to `~/.config/muse/daemon.json`; `--install` writes a macOS LaunchAgent plist (survives logout/reboot); `--interval` (5–86400s, default 60), `--lead-minutes` (1–1440, default 10), `--provider` (default env→config→`log`), `--destination` (default `@me`), `--print` echoes each delivered notice to stdout.
- **Enabled sub-ticks** (from `daemon --status`, all default to `log`/`@me`): proactive, reminders, followup, **objectives** — all `enabled`; ambient, web-watch, home-watch, briefing, self-learn, recap, email-sync, msg-poll, conflicts — all `disabled` behind env flags.
- **Evidence**: `daemon --status` ran (exit 0) and listed every tick + its source file path + autostart status. `commands-daemon.ts:registerDaemonCommands` (apps/cli) + `commands-daemon-config.ts` + `commands-daemon-launchagent.ts`. Tests: `commands-daemon.test.ts`, `commands-daemon-config.test.ts`.
- **`--once` safety note**: NOT run. `--once` fires a single tick of EACH enabled daemon and may deliver via the configured messaging provider; with default `log` provider that writes to the log sink (no external egress), but I treated it as a potential delivery and did not invoke it per the read-only constraint. Source confirms it is bounded/non-blocking (clamped interval, single-flight `firing` guard, `setInterval(...).unref()`).
- **Doc drift**: SYSTEM-MAP/FEATURES describe earned-proactivity/quiet-hours/check-ins but do NOT document the `muse daemon` command surface or its `--status/--init/--install` flags. (`daemon --status` prints **13 readiness lines**; `runTick` actually executes **19** ticks — the extra silent/throttled ones are checkins, pattern, reflection, selfLearnDecay, playbookConsolidate, memoryConsolidate.) ⚠️ moderate drift.

### API-side ticks (server-resident equivalents) ⬜🧪
- `apps/api/src/tick-daemons.ts` is the aggregator: `startReminderDaemonIfConfigured`, `startProactiveDaemonIfConfigured`, `startObjectivesDaemonIfConfigured`, plus ambient / web-watch / home-watch / pattern / situational-briefing / inbound-reply / messaging-poll ticks. Each `start*Tick` (e.g. `proactive-tick.ts`, `objectives-tick.ts`, `followup-tick.ts`, `reminder-tick.ts`, `pattern-tick.ts`) is a `setInterval` rider: default 60_000ms, clamped [5s, 1h], single-flight `firing` guard, `.unref()`, fail-soft (catches + logs), and gated by `quietHours`.
- Every tick is OFF unless its `MUSE_*_PROVIDER`/`DESTINATION` env (+ a signal source) is configured. Server + CLI daemon share `@muse/mcp` loop primitives — same guard semantics.

---

## B. Proactive notice engine (the surfacing core)

### Proactive surfacing loop — `runDueProactiveNotices` ⬜🧪
- **What**: Each tick finds imminent calendar events + due-soon tasks (lead window), dedupes against the fired ledger, optionally synthesizes a one-line LLM heads-up (Phase D), delivers via messaging provider (and optionally a terminal sink / agent-notice broker), and records to history + trust ledger. `packages/mcp/src/proactive-notice-loop.ts`.
- **Phase A** = calendar, **Phase B** = tasks, **Phase D** = agent-initiated LLM-composed turn delivered inline to a live chat (only when user seen within `activeSessionWindowMs`, default 5 min). `PHASE_D_SYSTEM_PROMPT` synthesizes via `modelProvider.generate` (preferred, no tools) or `agentRuntime`; defensive fallback to flat text if the small model emits tool-call JSON. 🤖 LLM-path.
- **Dedupe**: `proactive-notice-store.ts` — `~/.muse/proactive-fired.json`, key = `${kind}:${id}` + `startIso` (a moved meeting re-fires). FIFO trim 1000.

### `muse proactive` utility surface ✅🧪
Subcommands (verified via `--help` + live runs):
- `proactive scan` ✅ — dry-run of what would fire next tick. Ran: printed the 10-min window, "no imminent events / no due-soon tasks".
- `proactive watch` ⬜ — foreground daemon loop (long-running; NOT run). Has `--ignore-routine` (otherwise routine_active_hours/quiet-hours suppress), `--speak` (TTS).
- `proactive test` ⬜ — sends one test line to `MUSE_PROACTIVE_PROVIDER/DESTINATION`. NOT run (it sends).
- `proactive history` ✅ — audit `~/.muse/proactive-history.json`. Ran: "No proactive history yet".
- `proactive done` / `snooze <dur>` / `dismiss` ⬜ — act on the most-recent notice's task (NOT run; mutate).
- `proactive scoreboard | veto | keep | acted` ✅ — the **trust scoreboard** (see C). `scoreboard` ran live.
- **Evidence**: `commands-proactive.ts` + `chat-proactive.ts`. Tests: `commands-proactive.test.ts`, `chat-proactive.test.ts`.

### In-chat proactivity ("speaks-first") ⬜🧪
- `apps/cli/src/chat-proactive.ts` — pure helpers that decide what's imminent/new/how-phrased for the in-chat surface. Sources surfaced inline: due tasks, calendar events, **due check-ins**, **fireable patterns**, **completed background jobs**. `groupProactiveNotice` collapses several due things into ONE line (not a wall of notices). `imminentItems` (lead window + 2-min grace), `pickUnseen` (seen-set dedupe per session). All titles run through `stripUntrustedTerminalChars`.
- `proactive-notes-recall.ts` — wires confidence-gated cited recall (CRAG `decideProactiveRecall`) into the local daemon's `investigate` seam: surfaces a cited finding from the user's own notes ONLY when recall is confident; fail-open otherwise. (Grounding floor under proactivity.)
- Tests: `chat-proactive.test.ts`, `proactive-notes-recall.test.ts`, `proactive-terminal-sink.test.ts`.

---

## C. Earned proactivity + trust gate (the "earned it" machinery)

### Earned-proactivity persistence gate — `selectEarnedThemes` ⬜🧪
- **What**: A theme earns a proactive nudge only after it PERSISTS — seen across ≥ `minSources` (default 2) independent sources, ≥ `minOccurrences` (default 3) times, spanning ≥ `minDwellDays` (default 2), last seen within `activeWithinDays` (default 14). A single fleeting mention is filtered as noise. Modeled on the coherent type-1 feed-forward loop (Mangan & Alon 2003). Deterministic; only scores PAST occurrences (future calendar items are plans, not evidence). `packages/agent-core/src/earned-proactivity.ts`.
- **Evidence**: read in full. Decides WHEN it's earned, never WHAT to say (grounding floor governs the message).

### Proactive trust ledger / scoreboard ✅🧪
- **What**: `proactive-trust-ledger.ts` (`@muse/mcp`) records every surfaced notice (`appendSurfaced`) and the user's verdict (`recordOutcome`: `acted`/`kept`/`vetoed`). `computeTrustScore` → precision = fraction NOT vetoed (the "did proactivity earn its place" number). A pre-emptive veto on a never-surfaced source is `recordedWithoutSurface` and excluded from precision math. `~/.muse/proactive-trust.json`, atomic+fsync write via shared `atomic-file-store`, per-file mutation queue, FIFO trim 2000.
- **Evidence**: `proactive scoreboard` ran live — printed "Surfaced: 2000 Kept:0 Acted:0 Vetoed:0 Precision: 100%" + recent surfaces (test-seeded data present). `vetoed` = learned avoidance (source silenced going forward).
- **Tests**: `proactive-trust-ledger.test.ts`.

### Quiet hours / DND — `quiet-hours.ts` ⬜🧪
- **What**: `parseQuietHours` reads `MUSE_PROACTIVE_QUIET_HOURS` / `MUSE_REMINDER_QUIET_HOURS` (`22-7` or `22:00-07:00`, hour-granular, wraps midnight). `isQuietHour` checks the window; `gateProactiveNoticeSink` wraps a sink so ambient/awareness notices are suppressed during the window. Malformed input → `undefined` (fail to "always allowed", not silent self-disable). User-scheduled reminders/followups fire on their OWN path (urgent "pay rent" unaffected).
- **Evidence**: read in full. Used by both API ticks and CLI daemon (shared window). `proactive watch --ignore-routine` flag overrides routine quiet hours.

### Routine / active hours — `muse routine` ✅
- **What**: Aggregates `~/.muse/activity.jsonl` into `routine.active_hours` + `topDays`; `--apply` writes the fact to user-memory (gates when notices may fire). `--days` window (default 30), `--user`, `--json`.
- **Evidence**: ran live — "sessions: 5 across 1 day, top active hours: 19,03,18, top active days: Sun,Mon".

### Learned avoidance (veto) ⬜🧪
- `veto-avoidance.ts` (agent-core) injects a bounded `[Learned Avoidance]` soft-prompt block (≤ N vetoes; deterministic gate still enforces ALL). `personal-veto-store.ts` (`recordVeto`/`hasVeto`) is the authoritative store. Pattern dismissals are a distinct learned-avoidance path (see D). Tests: `personal-veto-store.test.ts`.

---

## D. Pattern detection → suggestion

### Pattern detector + fired/cooldown store ⬜🧪
- **What**: `@muse/memory` `pattern-detector.ts` / `pattern-orchestration.ts` detect time-of-day + weekly-task patterns (sha256-12 `patternId`). `personal-patterns-fired-store.ts` (`~/.muse/patterns-fired.json`) is the cooldown sidecar: `recordPatternFired`, `isPatternOnCooldown` (newest fire wins), `dismissPattern` + `isPatternDismissed` (learned avoidance — dismissed patterns NEVER fire again, surviving a cooldown reset). Atomic write, per-file mutation queue.
- **Surfacing**: `patternSuggestionItems` (chat-proactive) renders the detector's verbatim suggestion as a `💡` in-chat item. `pattern-suggestion.ts` (agent-core) + `pattern-tick.ts` (api).
- **CLI**: `muse pattern` (audit + cooldown management — adjacent, lightly in scope).

---

## E. Check-ins (proactive nudges on commitments)

### `muse checkins` ✅🧪
- **What**: `checkins scan` reads recent chat for commitments and schedules due-windowed next-day check-ins (`--slot-hour` default 10, `--max-per-day` default 3). `checkins list` ✅ (ran: "No scheduled check-ins"). `cancel <id>`, `snooze <id> <when>` (NL time). The daemon's `runDueCheckins` (`commitment-checkin.ts`) fires due ones to the user's OWN channel only (never third-party), honoring quiet hours (DND gates the whole tick), `maxPerTick` default 5, and patches only fired ids under a mutation queue (a concurrent cancel is preserved, a cancelled nudge is never resurrected).
- **Evidence**: `checkins list` ran live. `commitment-detector.ts` (agent-core) detects commitments. Tests: `commands-checkins.test.ts`.
- **Doc**: FEATURES.md line 89 ✅ documents this accurately (incl. session-end auto-scan opt-in, in-chat surfacing).

---

## F. Standing objectives (delegated autonomy)

### `muse objectives` ✅🧪
- **What**: Register "watch X / until Z / tell me when W" objectives the daemon re-evaluates autonomously. `objectives add <spec> --kind watch|until|notify` (default `until`), `list --status active|done|escalated|cancelled|all` ✅, `cancel <id>` (gave up), `done <id>` (achieved). `--user` owner bucket.
- **Evidence**: `objectives list` ran live ("No objectives"). Store: `personal-objectives-store.ts`. Loop: `objective-evaluation-loop.ts` `runDueObjectives` + `objectives-tick.ts` (api). Tests: `commands-objectives.test.ts`, `personal-objectives-store.test.ts`, `objective-evaluator.test.ts`.

### Outbound safety: consent gate + draft-first actuator ⬜🧪 (SAFETY-CRITICAL)
- **`performConsentedAction`** (`consented-action.ts`): an objective may perform an external HTTP action with a scoped credential ONLY when consent is RECORDED for that exact `{objective, scope}`. Fail-closed + deterministic: no consent ⇒ no HTTP call, ever. A matching **veto overrides prior consent** (checked first). Credential is bound to `consent.allowedHost` (fail-closed on host mismatch or unparseable URL → token never leaves — credential-exfil guard). Caller-supplied `authorization` header stripped. 30s timeout cap. Transport injected (`fetchImpl`) — tested over a real request shape, never a fake "did it" flag.
- **Two actuators** (`objective-evaluator.ts`): `createMessagingObjectiveActuator` notifies the user's OWN channel ("✅ Objective met") + logs to action log (low-risk reply-to-user). `createProposingObjectiveActuator` for third-party-bound notifications PROPOSES a pending action (draft-first) instead of sending — user confirms via `muse propose approve`. This is `outbound-safety.md` as code.
- **Tests**: `consented-action.test.ts`, `personal-consent-store.test.ts`, `objective-evaluator.test.ts`.

---

## G. Draft-first proposals (the outbound gate surface)

### `muse propose` ✅🧪
- **What**: Review/confirm actions Muse proposed; nothing sends until approved. `propose list` ✅ (ran: "No proposed actions awaiting confirmation"), `approve <id>` (executes the draft exactly ONCE → `executed`), `decline <id>` (→ `declined` + a veto so the class stops re-proposing).
- **Store**: `personal-proposed-action-store.ts` — `pending|executed|declined`, `expiresAt` TTL default 24h (`isProposalActionable` = pending AND not expired; an expired proposal is inert — outbound-safety's "approval times out → no action"). Atomic+fsync write, per-file mutation queue (approve/decline patch-by-id never clobbered). Only `message` kind today.
- **Tests**: `commands-propose.test.ts`.

### `muse approvals` ✅🧪 (channel-approval pending worklist)
- **What**: Review or durably deny channel actions awaiting approval (the LIVE pending worklist, distinct from `propose`). `approvals list` shows unexpired pending ids. `approve <id>` claims the exact stored draft before execution, records `succeeded | unknown`, and blocks every replay; `clear <id>` records a durable `denied` tombstone. A channel "yes" only returns the CLI command for that id and never executes the action itself.
- **Safety**: API and CLI share the `@muse/messaging` claim/CAS store and negative-first outcome classifier. The boundary is at-most-once: a post-claim crash can omit an effect, but the id cannot execute twice. Tombstones are not pruned automatically in this slice.
- Adjacent: `muse approval` (singular) = pending tool-call approvals audit+decide (overlaps the approvals/guard domain). Tests: `commands-approvals.test.ts`, `commands-approval.test.ts`.

---

## H. Accountability: action log + undo

### `muse actions` — the accountability log ✅🧪
- **What**: Review what Muse did autonomously (or refused). Filters `--result performed|refused|failed|all`, `--user` (or `all`), `--limit`. **`--verify`** checks a tamper-evident hash-chain (each entry's `prevHash` binds to all prior history — a deletion/edit/reorder breaks verification at a precise index). Encryption-at-rest: `encrypt`/`decrypt`/`encryption-status` subcommands (AES-256-GCM, key = `MUSE_MEMORY_KEY` or per-host).
- **Evidence (ran live)**: `actions --limit 5` → showed a `[refused]` "declined proposal … not sent" entry; `actions --verify` → "✓ chain intact — 3979 linked entries verified"; `actions encryption-status` → "plaintext (~/.muse/action-log.json)".
- **Store**: `personal-action-log-store.ts` — `appendActionLog` (chained, serialized append queue), `queryActionLog` (newest-first by parsed instant), `verifyActionLogChainFile`. Result enum `performed|refused|failed`. Tests: `personal-action-log-store.test.ts`, `commands-actions.test.ts`.

### Undo + veto — `undoLoggedAction` ⬜🧪
- **What**: Reverses a logged action where reversible (injected `reverse()`), ALWAYS records a veto (`veto_${objectiveId}_${scope}`) so the class can't recur (learned avoidance), and appends an `undo_*` action-log entry. Irreversible action → veto still recorded ("irreversible — veto recorded so it cannot recur"). `packages/mcp/src/undo-action.ts`.
- **Tests**: `undo-action.test.ts`.
- **Doc**: FEATURES.md line 157 ✅ documents accountability+undo+learned-avoidance accurately.

---

## I. Sessions / Focus-DND

### `muse session` ✅🧪
- **What**: Focus / Do-Not-Disturb controls for proactive notices. `session lock --hours/--minutes [--reason]` (pause until elapsed, default 1h), `session unlock` (resume immediately), `session status` ✅ (ran: "session unlocked").
- **Store**: `~/.muse/session-lock.json` (`writeSessionLock`/`readSessionLock` in proactive-notice-store.ts) — atomic 0o600 write, fail-OPEN read (a corrupt marker can't permanently silence the daemon). `runDueProactiveNotices` reads it each tick and reports `sessionLockedUntil` + skips firing. Optional `reason` surfaced in `session status` + daemon log.
- **Tests**: `commands-session.test.ts`.
- **Note on "Sessions"**: This domain's "session" = the DND lock ONLY. The broader continuous-companion session model (recap / `/memory` / episodes) lives in other domains; `muse episode` is the prior-session summary surface (adjacent).

---

## J. External-signal triggers

### `muse watch-folder` ⬜🧪
- **What**: Watch a folder (default `~/.muse/inbox`) for new files and fire each as a proactive notice — credential-free external trigger. `--as-task` (creates a tracked task per file so the daemon picks it up; `--default-lead-minutes` default 60 when no due:/마감: line), `--ingest` (ingest each new file INTO the notes corpus as a citable `.md` instead of firing a notice; `--notes-prefix` default `inbox`), `--provider`/`--destination`. NOT run (long-running watcher).
- **Tests**: `commands-watch-folder.test.ts`.

### `muse webhook serve` ⬜🧪
- **What**: Loopback HTTP server — `POST /notify` body → proactive notice (+ optional task with `--as-task`). `--port` default 7777, **`--host` default 127.0.0.1 (local-only, not exposed beyond the machine)**, `--provider`/`--destination`. NOT run (long-running listener). Source confirms loopback bind by default.
- **Tests**: `commands-webhook.test.ts`. (Distinct from `apps/api/messaging-webhooks-routes.ts` = inbound messaging webhooks.)

### `muse agent-notices tail` ⬜🧪
- **What**: Stream agent-initiated heads-ups (Phase D) for this user until Ctrl-C (`--user`, `--json`). Consumes the API SSE endpoint `GET /api/agent-notices/stream?userId=` (`agent-notices-routes.ts`), backed by the in-process `InMemoryAgentInitiatedNoticeBroker` (`agent-core/agent-initiated-notice.ts`): per-subscriber queue cap (default 16, oldest dropped on overflow), dropped-count diagnostic, fan-out to all subscribers of a userId, unsubscribe on disconnect (in-flight drain stops). NOT run (streaming).
- **Tests**: `commands-agent-notices.test.ts`.

### `muse feeds` — RSS/Atom ambient world-state ✅🧪
- **What**: `feeds add <url>` (fetch-once on add), `list` ✅ (ran: "no feeds"), `remove <id>`, `refresh [--id]`, `today` ✅ (ran: "no entries in last 24h"), `search <query>` (whole cached archive). Feeds ambient signal into proactivity. `feeds-store.ts`, `feed-dedupe.ts`, `brief-feeds.ts`. Tests: `commands-feeds.test.ts`, `feeds-store.test.ts`, `feed-dedupe.test.ts`, `brief-feeds.test.ts`.

---

## K. Unified activity views (read surfaces)

### `muse history` ✅ + `muse open` ⬜
- `history` ✅ — unified feed across reminder/proactive/followup/pattern/episode stores, newest first. `--kind`, `--since`, `--limit` (cap 200), `--grep`+`--case-sensitive`, `--json`. Ran: showed 3 followup entries.
- `open <prefix>` ⬜ — look up an activity record by ID prefix across every store (first hit wins, ambiguous surfaced); `--json`/`--raw`. Tests: `commands-history.test.ts`, `commands-open.test.ts`.

### `muse today` ✅ (proactive side)
- Morning briefing — open tasks + next-24h calendar + recent notes. `--brief` (NL summary via model 🤖), `--speak` (TTS), `--connect` (related past notes/sessions), `--local`, `--json`. Adjacent helpers: `today-stale-revisit.ts` (stale-task + episode-revisit), `today-feeds`/`commands-today-feeds.ts`. Tests: `commands-today.test.ts`, `today-stale-revisit.test.ts`, `commands-today-api-warn.test.ts`.

---

## BROKEN / SUSPICIOUS

1. ⚠️ **`muse proactive-trust` is NOT a command** — `node …/index.js proactive-trust --help` falls back to ROOT help, and `proactive-trust` (no --help) errors: `error: unknown command 'proactive-trust'`. The brief lists it as a command but the real surface is `registerProactiveTrustSubcommands` adding `scoreboard`/`veto`/`keep`/`acted` UNDER `muse proactive`. The file `commands-proactive-trust.ts` + `commands-proactive-trust.test.ts` exist but only register SUBcommands. This is a naming trap, not a code bug — but any doc that says `muse proactive-trust …` would be wrong. (No drift in current docs — they don't mention it.)
2. ⚠️ **Trust scoreboard shows test-seeded data** in the live store (`~/.muse/proactive-trust.json`: 2000 entries, many `task:t1 "Ship the memo"` from 12:31/12:44 today). Not a code bug — it's a dev/test machine artifact (tests writing to the real home store). Worth noting for anyone reading the live scoreboard as "real usage".
3. ℹ️ **`daemon --once` not exercised** (constraint-safe): it can deliver via the messaging provider, so I captured `--status` instead. The static read confirms it is bounded + single-flight; treat "fires a single tick" as code-verified, not run-verified.

---

## DOC DRIFT (vs docs/FEATURES.md, docs/SYSTEM-MAP.md, README.md)

- **Accurate ✅**: earned-proactivity (FEATURES 148, SYSTEM-MAP 147), quiet-hours/DND (FEATURES 149), check-ins (FEATURES 89), standing objectives + consent fail-close (now FEATURES :167, marked ✅ as of 2026-06-14), accountability+undo+learned-avoidance (FEATURES 157). These match the code well.
- **MISSING from docs ⚠️**: No documentation of the **`muse daemon` command** itself (`--status/--init/--install/--once`, its ticks — 13 readiness lines / 19 actual ticks, LaunchAgent autostart). No docs for **`muse watch-folder`**, **`muse webhook serve`**, **`muse agent-notices tail`** (external-signal triggers / Phase D SSE stream). No docs for the **proactive trust scoreboard** CLI (`muse proactive scoreboard/veto/keep/acted`) or **`muse propose`** / **`muse approvals`** draft-first surfaces. No docs for **`muse feeds`** ambient world-state, **`muse routine`**, **`muse history`/`open`**, or the **action-log hash-chain `--verify`** + encryption subcommands.
- **Staleness signal**: FEATURES.md / SYSTEM-MAP.md were last refreshed 2026-06-14 (this pass). The CLI still exposes ~10 proactive/accountability surfaces (daemon command, watch-folder, webhook, agent-notices, feeds, routine, history/open, propose, approvals, action-log `--verify`) that are not yet prosed into the feature docs — see INDEX §4 D9. Standing objectives were promoted ⚙️→✅ in FEATURES :167 (actuators + objectives-tick + `muse objectives` CLI all present + tested; tick shows `enabled` in `daemon --status`).

## Test evidence summary
- ~52 domain test files across `apps/cli/src`, `packages/mcp/src`, `packages/agent-core/src`, `apps/api/src`.
- Safety-critical paths have dedicated tests: `consented-action.test.ts`, `objective-evaluator.test.ts`, `personal-action-log-store.test.ts` (hash-chain), `undo-action.test.ts`, `personal-veto-store.test.ts`, `proactive-trust-ledger.test.ts`, `personal-proposed-action-store` (via commands-propose).
- (Tests not executed here — read-only catalog pass; existence + naming verified.)
